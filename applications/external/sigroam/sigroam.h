 * Brand / referral slot (About page).
 *
 * SR_BRAND_URL is the app's only outbound entry point, and it **resolves to the
 * same short link** as the QR code in the top-right of the About page
 * (assets/sr1g_qr.png, encoding "https://" SR_BRAND_URL).
 * Plaintext and code must both be present: the established product-line finding
 * is "print the plaintext short link next to the code -- the security audience
 * does not scan unknown codes, and plaintext equals trust", and wardriving users
 * are exactly that audience.
 *
 * The short code sr1g follows the frozen naming rule `<product><hw version><purpose>`:
 * sr=SigRoam / 1=v1 / g=github.
 * The target lives in Cloudflare KV, so **changing it needs no code change and no reflash**.
 *
 * Constraints (read before editing):
 *  (1) The plaintext line must be <= 20 chars (one full-width row). It is exactly
 *      20 today, leaving **zero headroom** -- any longer and it wraps, and since
 *      the About page moved to a hand-drawn layout there is no scrolling, so the
 *      wrapped part is simply invisible.
 *  (2) Changing this value REQUIRES regenerating assets/sr1g_qr.png, or the code
 *      and the plaintext point to different places.
 *      With the "https://" prefix the URL is 28 chars; QR version 3 (29x29 modules)
 *      at error correction M holds 42 bytes, leaving 14 spare -- the short code can
 *      grow from 4 up to 18 chars without changing version or code size.
 *  (3) Platform compliance: all 8 clauses of the official Contributing.md impose no
 *      restriction on commercial promotion, outbound links, or branding (read
 *      2026-08-31), but clause 8 reserves refusal "for any reason" -- so keep the
 *      tone out of advertising register.
 *
 * SR_BRAND_NAME is the maker word. About line 2 is SR_BRAND_LINE
 * ("by PINGEQUA Lab", 74 px). Changing the spelling must keep line 2 <= 91 px
 * (FontSecondary advance; that row shares y with the QR).

 *    4-module quiet zone each side, box_size=1). A URL past 42 bytes jumps to
 *    V4 (33 modules -> 41 px) and must be mirrored here.
 *  - X is right-aligned: 91 + 37 = 128. Rows that share the code's y range
 *    have 91 px on the left.
 *  - Y = 13 sits on the second-row cap (row 1 descender ends y=12) so row 1
 *    is a full-width title bar. The code occupies y=13..49; the URL cap at
 *    y=53 stays below it. Y outside 13..15 either clips row 1 or the URL.
 * The quiet zone is already inside the 37. Drawing into x>=91 and
 * y in [Y, Y+SIDE) makes the code unscannable. */
