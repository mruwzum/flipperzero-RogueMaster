# Changelog

All notable changes to SigRoam are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Plugging in or unplugging the Flipper's USB cable during a survey no longer leaves Dash counting while the board has stopped scanning. With SigRoam firmware, Dash now checks the board's own state. If the board has stopped, Dash starts a new survey within about 15 seconds. If the board is still saving or uploading, Dash shows `Resyncing...` and waits for it to finish. After 3 minutes without success, Dash shows `Scan lost, press OK`. The survey continues in a new file, and Dash counts restart from 0.
- Dash no longer sends a stop when USB is unplugged while the SigRoam board is still scanning.

## [0.6] — 2026-09-24

For Scout Lite running SigRoam 0.6.

### Added

- Dash shows 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz counts separately.
- A new network plays one short sound, at most once every 2 seconds, and does not vibrate. Settings: New net tick.
- After you stop, Dash keeps a one-line summary of that survey.
- If sealed surveys are still waiting, Dash asks once whether to upload. It tells you when the WiGLE key or home Wi-Fi is not set.
- Upload shows Key and Home.
- Rank shows your WiGLE account rank, not the count from this drive.
- Unleashed build: `sigroam-0.6-unleashed.fap`.

### Changed

- Probe and About show v0.6.
- Upload distinguishes a missing WiGLE reply, a rejected key, and WiGLE busy.

## [0.5] — 2026-09-23

BLE observation and on-board WiGLE upload for Scout Lite. Not product v1.0.

The scanner app is SHA-256 `13e13033ad2f124b6edb4c599b99e10fb576872964169ea627fb8b320ea54b7c`, 1638160 bytes, written at `0x20000`. Bootloader, partition table, and otadata stay the v0.4 bytes. A sealed survey on that app wrote 66 BLE rows (`obs_ble=5784`).

### Added

- The scanner uploads a sealed WiGLE CSV. Success is an official `transId` stored next to that file.
- HTTP 429 stops the round and records `reason=HTTP_429`. It does not mark the round done. That status is WiGLE's daily file limit.
- Upload shows `WiGLE busy` / `try later` when the diag state is 5, there is no id, and the reason is `HTTP_429`. A real id still shows `Uploaded`. Any other state 5 stays `Sending`.
- This scanner image observes BLE. Dash shows the live BLE count. There is no separate BLE switch.

### Changed

- Probe shows SigRoam / v0.5 / Scout Lite. It does not show the UART `Version:` line.

## [0.4] — 2026-09-17

Scout Lite identity on the Sess tab, a capture-quality headline, BLE-off on
Dash, a Dash/GPS layout pass, About lockup A2, and a second Unleashed build.

### Added

- **The Sess tab names a Scout Lite board SigRoam.** The eight-byte wire token
  is still `Firmware: Marauder` and is not shown on this tab. The status line
  is Running or Sealed, the duration, and the radio permission (`W+B` / `W` /
  `B` / `--`). A generic Marauder board still shows the wire firmware name.
- **Dashboard capture-quality headline.** When the scanner sends `Qual:`, Dash
  shows fix%, drop and net, refreshed on the shared 5-second tick. A stale
  headline degrades instead of looking current.
- **Dash shows BLE=OFF** when the scanner reports `Radio: ble=0`.
- **A second `.fap` for Unleashed.** Official 1.4.3 and Momentum `mntm-012`
  both report API 87.1, so one Official-SDK build covers both. Unleashed
  `unlshd-093` (2026-09-12) is API 88.9; the loader compares the API major
  exactly, so that firmware needs its own file. Tapping Continue on an API
  mismatch is not support.

### Changed

- The app title is **SigRoam Wardriving**. Probe names SigRoam firmware when
  it is talking to this scanner. The handshake token on the wire is unchanged.
- **About lockup A2:** `SigRoam Wardriving v0.4` on one line (normal spacing),
  maker line `by PINGEQUA Lab`, QR dropped to the second row. On-device
  version matches `fap_version` 0.4 (it still said 0.3). Receive-only, No
  attack, Marauder compatible, and the QR short link are unchanged.
- The unique-BSSID count is the big number at the top of Dash again.
- The status line sits on the bottom: OK, fix percent, drop, and SAT. Bytes
  received (`rx=`) no longer show on the normal Dash while a SigRoam scan is
  running.
- The GPS tab dropped the `(live)` tag. Accuracy is labelled `Acc:~` because
  it is an estimate.
- SAT on Dash and GPS comes from the survey snapshot or a fresh Qual reading,
  not a separate `gpsdata` poll during a scan.
- Probe sends `info` a second time if the scanner does not answer in 1.5 s.
- While a stock Marauder scan is running with no AP or BLE rows yet, Dash
  shows `Waiting for first AP` instead of a zeroed count line. Stream stays
  `No APs yet`.
- On the GPS tab, an empty scan log is only `No GPS data yet`. A scan row
  with no datetime shows `POI: no fix in log`.
- Dash does not send `info` to a stock Marauder. That command is not
  read-only there: it leaves `SHOW_INFO` and the next wardrive never starts.
- After Probe recognises a generic Marauder, the app sends `stopscan` once
  so Dash can start a scan. SigRoam firmware is unchanged.
- Empty Version is not treated as a generic Marauder. Dash holds START
  until Version arrives; 1500 ms is retry spacing, not the end of the hold.
- Dash shows `No SD` / `Saving...` and does not cover those with the ident
  overlay.
- Probe retries `info` until Version arrives or the send cap.

## [0.3] — 2026-09-04

Scan control, where the GPS reading comes from, the notification switches, and
one file to download instead of two.

### Added

- **The Sound, Vibro, Backlight and Stealth switches now do something.** They
  have been in Settings since 0.1, stored and displayed but never read by
  anything. The app now alerts you when the GPS fix changes state during a
  survey: a rising two-note beep and a green blink when the fix is acquired, a
  falling beep and a red blink when it is lost, and a short vibrate on either.
  Each channel is gated on its own switch — Stealth suppresses the LED — and
  alerts are throttled to at most one every 3 seconds, with the first one after
  a restart always allowed through. Backlight, when on, holds the display lit
  for as long as you are on the dashboard instead of letting it time out
  mid-drive.

### Changed

- **A release now ships one `.fap` instead of one per firmware.** Built against
  the Official SDK. Loading is gated on the API major. This build targets API 87
  (Official firmware 1.4.3). CFW images that report the same API major can load
  the same file; images on a different API major are not covered. Building this
  source against both SDKs produced files that differ in five bytes — a
  debug-link checksum and one byte of section size — with every code, data,
  relocation and symbol section byte-identical. `sigroam-0.3.fap` is the whole
  download; there is nothing to pick.
- **The GPS reading now comes from the survey data itself.** Until now the GPS
  tab was filled by a separate `gpsdata` query, which the scanner answers only
  when it is not scanning — so the one moment you actually want a position was
  the one moment the reading went stale. Each scan row already carries its own
  latitude, longitude and timestamp, and the tab now reads those, marked
  `(live)` to distinguish them from a sampled reading. Sampling still works on
  the GPS tab while no scan is running.

### Fixed

- **Pressing OK during a scan start or stop no longer stacks up commands.** The
  key was mapped from two states only. While the app was waiting for the scanner
  to confirm a stop, or while it was busy, another press sent another command on
  top of the one still in flight; and after a stop had failed, OK sent a start
  rather than retrying the stop. All seven states are now mapped explicitly:
  transitional states send nothing, and a failed stop retries the stop.
- **A command that failed to reach the scanner no longer looked like it had been
  sent.** The pending marker was cleared regardless of whether the write
  succeeded, so a failed send left the dashboard waiting for a reply to a
  command that never left the Flipper.

## [0.2] — 2026-09-03

Power handling. Both fixes come from one wrong assumption about where the 5 V on
pin 1 comes from, showing up from two directions.

### Fixed

- **The serial port would not open while USB was plugged in.** 0.1 treated the
  OTG boost converter as the only source of 5 V on pin 1 and refused to open the
  port whenever the boost was off. The firmware deliberately keeps the boost off
  while USB VBUS is above 4.5 V — the charger refuses it — and pin 1 is fed
  straight from VBUS in that case, so the port was being closed on a board that
  had power the whole time. The app now checks both sources: VBUS above the
  threshold opens the port, and only below it does the boost state decide.
  Running on a car charger now works the same as running on battery.
- **Unplugging USB stopped the survey without saying so.** Power handover to the
  battery succeeds, but the scanner board browns out and restarts into its
  non-scanning state. 0.1 did not notice: the byte counter simply stopped rising
  while the session timer kept going, so collection could stop with nothing on
  screen to show it. The app now detects the stall and re-issues the scan command
  until the board answers again. On the reference board that takes 67 to 77
  seconds — the time the scanner needs to boot and accept commands — and the
  retries are bounded at 24 attempts, 5 seconds apart, capped at 2 minutes.
- **The README presented the old behaviour as a hardware limitation.** It told
  you the scanner had no power while USB was connected and that you had to unplug
  USB and restart the app. That was a consequence of the power gate above, not of
  the hardware. Corrected, along with the FAQ entry built on it.

### Added

- **Resync status on the Dash tab** — `Resyncing...` while the app is bringing
  the scanner back, a distinct message if the retries run out, and a diagnostic
  row showing the state of the resync itself.

### Changed

- The OTG request is now left standing while USB feeds pin 1, so the power
  service raises the boost on its own the moment USB is unplugged. Handover from
  a car charger to the battery no longer requires restarting the app.
- The power line in the serial log is now prefixed `pwr:` rather than `otg:` and
  reports the measured VBUS voltage next to the OTG state.

## [0.1] — 2026-09-02

First public release. Wi-Fi survey front-end for the Flipper Zero driving an
external ESP32 Marauder scanner over the GPIO serial port.

### Added

- **Dashboard** with four tabs (left/right to switch): live counters, parsed
  record stream, GPS status, and session diagnostics. OK on the Dash tab starts
  and stops the scan; the scan keeps running when you leave the page with Back.
- **Firmware probe** — sends `info` and reports what answered, distinguishing
  "nothing connected" from "connected but not Marauder".
- **Raw log** — unparsed serial lines, including anything the parser did not
  recognise, so a malformed feed is inspectable rather than invisible.
- **Settings** — baud rate (six choices, default 115200), source codec, sound,
  vibro, backlight, stealth, and debug rows. Persisted across restarts.
- **Unique-BSSID estimate** from a 4 KB Bloom filter (32768 bits, 4 hashes),
  session-scoped and RAM-only.
- **GPIO serial handling** with the OTG power gate, physical-state verification
  before opening the port, and detection of the Log Device conflict on pins
  13/14 — each reported on screen instead of failing silently.
- **QR code on the About page** linking to this repository.

### Notes

- Receive-only by design. No deauthentication, handshake capture, evil twin,
  karma, beacon/BLE spam, or password cracking — permanently out of scope.
- Survey data is not written to the Flipper's SD card. Logging is the scanner's
  job; the Flipper provides control and live visibility.
- Built against the official SDK (API 87) using only the common Flipper API.
