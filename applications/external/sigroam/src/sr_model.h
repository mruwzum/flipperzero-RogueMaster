/*
 * ★ Session state machine + statistics + ring buffer. Must not include any furi header (ADR-003).
 *
 * Condenses the SrEvent stream into state the UI can draw directly. Pure logic.
 *
 * Hard constraints (ADR-009 / ADR-010):
 *   - Ring buffer elements are SrApBrief; storing SrApRecord is forbidden (232 B x 64 blows the budget).
 *   - Must not retain SrEvent; it only passes through as an sr_model_apply argument.
 *   - SrEvent.u.unknown.text is a borrowed view; retaining it requires memcpy of len bytes plus your own NUL.
 *     sr_strlcpy / strlen are forbidden (only [text, text+len) is guaranteed readable; see the ADR-010 readable-range contract).
 *   - Touches no clock; when a timestamp is needed the caller passes tick_ms in.
 *   - SrBloom is owned by the caller; only a pointer is kept here. Do not embed the 4 KB bit array.
 *   - SrRawLog is owned by the caller; only a pointer is kept here. Do not embed the ring (ADR-018).
 *
 * The SrApBrief layout is settled (task card T2.4; the main session measured 34 B with host clang on 2026-08-16):
 *   ssid[25] + mac[6] + rssi + channel + flags, all members 1-byte aligned, no padding.
 *   flags bit0 = radio (0=WIFI / 1=BLE), bit1 = this entry has a GPS fix. Do not invent a third bit.
