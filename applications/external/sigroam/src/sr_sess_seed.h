 * ★ Pure-logic decision layer. Must not include any furi header (ADR-003).

 * Card N6 -- seed ap_wifi / ap_ble / started_tick_ms from the board's Sess:
 * line after an N1 adoption.
 *
 * Seeding is a second, idempotent step, independent of dash_peer_sync_tick().
 * It must not ride firmware_rev: probe_n() returns true for each of
 * Firmware: / Version: / Hardware: / ESP-IDF: / Diag:, so one #info bumps
 * firmware_rev five times and the N1 one-shot path would disarm before Sess:
 * (the last line of that reply, n6-fap-sess-consume.md §2) has arrived.
 *
 * The predicate is "sess_rev changed since this Dash info was sent".
 * Snapshot sess_rev in on_enter **before** queuing info (sess_rev_at_send),
 * same shape as peer_sync_fw_rev. Do **not** snapshot at adopt: a 26 ms
 * #info often lands inside one 100 ms tick, so adopt would freeze the new
 * sess_rev and wait forever (n6-fap-sess-consume.md §5).
 *
 * sess_rev != 0 alone is "historically seen", which reuses a Probe-scene
 * snapshot and never corrects (C3/C4). Compared with != , never > : sess_rev
 * wraps. Pending is cleared only after a successful seed.
