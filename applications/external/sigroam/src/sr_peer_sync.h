/*
 * ★ Pure-logic decision layer. Must not include any furi header (ADR-003).
 *
 * Card N1 -- adopt the board's session on app launch.
 *
 * This model starts at SrSessionIdle every time the app launches, while the board
 * keeps scanning after the app exits. That asymmetry is deliberate, not a bug:
 * scene_start.c:13-16 states it outright -- "while a scan runs, Back returns to the
 * main menu without stopping the scan (Stop is triggered only by OK on the Dash
 * tab)" -- because the product use is "the board drives itself, the Flipper is only
 * a remote". Nothing on the exit path sends stopscan; the only four build_stop_cmd
 * call sites are resync, the two GPS-sample close-outs, and the Dash OK key.
 *
 * So after a relaunch the two sides disagree, and the Dash OK key maps to wardrive
 * (sr_scan_ctl.h:53 falls through to SrScanUiIdle, and sr_scan_ctl_on_ok maps Idle
 * to SrScanActSendStart), which the board refuses. Measured 2026-09-09 over the
 * Flipper USB-UART bridge, board left SCANNING by an earlier FAP session:
 *
 *     TX  info      -> Diag: st=1 seal=00  /  CmdTrace: boot=1 post=1/0 deq=1 accept=1 open=1/0
 *     TX  wardrive  -> #wardrive
 *                      Busy: st=1 seal=00
 *     TX  info      -> CmdTrace unchanged, byte for byte; state still SCANNING
 *
 * Refusing is correct on the board's side -- firmware session_gate.h:28
 * sr_session_start_acceptable() accepts only IDLE or SEALED, so a new session cannot
 * clobber one that has not finished sealing. The fix therefore belongs here: believe
 * the Diag: line instead of assuming Idle. Decided by the user 2026-09-09; changing
 * the firmware and auto-stopping on exit were both ruled out.
 */

 * scenes/scene_probe.c:63-64 already renders them in this order.

 * diag_seen / diag_state come from SrFirmwareInfo, filled by the Diag: parser
 * (sr_parse_marauder.c:438, strict -- a half-read line is rejected outright).
 * cur is this model's session; cmd_pending is app->scan.cmd_pending.
 *
 * Only SCANNING is adopted. The other three refusing states are left alone on
 * purpose, and this is the whole of the reasoning, so it does not have to be
 * re-derived later:
 *   - STOPPING (2) / DRAINING (3): the board is already sealing, which takes seconds,
 *     and it answers Busy: st=2 / st=3 on its own. sr_scan_ctl.h reacts to that
 *     through busy_rev (dash_scan_tick clears cmd_pending on an explicit refusal), so
 *     the UI already says something true. Adopting them would need a fourth UI state
 *     for a window measured in seconds.
 *   - UPLOADING (5): reserved for firmware T5.3, and session_gate.h:17-19 says T2.5
 *     must never enter it. Adopting a state the board cannot currently report would be
 *     untestable code.
 * ⚠ So this function does NOT make every Busy go away -- it removes the one that
 * lasts as long as the session does. Scope decided by the user 2026-09-09.
 *
 * cmd_pending is a hard guard, not a nicety. A stopscan queued by the OK key leaves
 * cmd_pending true while the board still reports SCANNING for a few hundred ms; a
 * Diag: reply landing in that window would re-adopt Running and bump session_rev,
 * and session_rev rising is exactly the confirmation signal sr_scan_ctl_eval watches
 * (rev_rose). Adopting there would corrupt the in-flight command's verdict.
