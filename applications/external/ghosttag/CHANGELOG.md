## [2.0.0] — 2026-09-27

A correctness and usability release. Every screen was rebuilt, two deadlock
classes were removed, and the app now does something useful with no extra
hardware at all.

### The big one: the official devboard never worked

The README, the app description and the ESP32 sketch all told people to use the
official Flipper WiFi Devboard. That board is an **ESP32-S2, which has no
Bluetooth radio of any kind** — so GhostTag's documented primary hardware could
never have found a single tracker. Anyone who followed the instructions got a
board that flashed perfectly and then sat there forever.

- The sketch now **refuses to compile** for an S2 rather than producing a
  useless binary.
- The README, the About screen and the app description name the boards that
  actually work (ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, classic ESP32), with real
  products.

### Added

- **An onboard energy mode was built, tested on hardware, and compiled out.**
  RF test mode looks like it should let the Flipper measure raw channel energy
  without decoding anything. On official firmware (API 87) it does not:
  `furi_hal_bt_ensure_c2_mode` reports the radio core up, the radio is
  released with `bt_disconnect` + `furi_hal_bt_stop_advertising`, and then
  `furi_hal_bt_get_rssi()` returns exactly `0.0` — this stack's failed-read
  value — for every sample, on **both** `furi_hal_bt_start_rx` and
  `furi_hal_bt_start_packet_rx`. The code is kept and correct, but gated behind
  `GHOSTTAG_ENABLE_AIR_CHECK` rather than shipped as a menu entry that can only
  ever say NO READING. See the README for the full result table.
- **Demo mode** — a scripted stalking scenario played through the real UI,
  needing no hardware. An ambient phone and earbuds that are never graded
  threats, a Tile that walks past and leaves without tripping, an AirTag that
  stays and trips at ~20 s, and a SmartTag that joins later. Every demo screen
  is stamped `DEMO`, and a demo session is never written to the log.
- **Settings now persist.** They were RAM-only, so the app forgot everything on
  close — including somebody turning Sound off because they did not want a
  stalker to hear the alert.
- **Session log** to `apps_data/ghosttag/sessions.csv`, capped at 64 KB, with
  *full* reported distinctly from *failed*. Demo sessions are never logged.
- **Boot intro**, and a **Help & About** screen that answers the question a
  first-run user actually has ("why does it say NO BOARD?").
- **Left / Right on the detail screen** step through the detections, and a
  `<3/12>` counter says so. The screen previously had no working key at all.
- **`Clear detections`** in the main menu, and a count beside `Detections`.
- Settings gained **Screen on** and **Log to SD**, plus a **Restore defaults**
  row — which also gives `OK` something to do on a screen where it previously
  did nothing at all.
- `tools_check_layout.py`, `tools_strict_build.py`, `tools_screenshot.py`,
  `tools_gen_banner.py`, `tools_brand_data.py`. The first two run in CI.

### Fixed

- **Two-thread deadlock on teardown.** The radio worker called into the view
  dispatcher, which blocks when its queue is full; the thread that drains that
  queue is the GUI thread, which was simultaneously blocked in
  `furi_thread_join`. Detections now only touch the database and the GUI polls
  for alerts on its tick, so nothing crosses a thread boundary.
- **Dead buttons.** Every view handled `InputTypeShort` only. The firmware
  sends `InputTypeLong` — never Short — once a key is held past the long-press
  threshold, so a slightly firm press was silently dropped on the radar, the
  list and the alert screen. All views now accept Short **or** Long.
- **Lost alerts.** The pending alert was a single slot, so a second tracker
  tripping before the UI drained its queue overwrote the first and that warning
  was gone for good. Promotions are now queued in the records themselves.
- **Alerts were dropped entirely** on the detail, settings and about screens.
- **The alert re-opened itself.** `OK` pushed the detail screen on top of the
  alert, so backing out re-armed a strobing alarm the user had already dealt
  with. The alert is popped first.
- **A second alert stacked another scene**, leaving the user pressing Back
  through a pile of alarms. It now re-points the alert already on screen.
- **The list selection jumped under your finger.** The snapshot is re-sorted on
  every refresh, so a one-dB wobble swapped two rows and `OK` opened the wrong
  device. Selection is anchored to the device address.
- **The link indicator lied.** Liveness was inferred from detections, so a
  working board in a quiet room reported `NO ESP`. The ESP32 now heartbeats and
  any line counts as proof of life — and "never heard a board" is now worded
  differently from "the board went quiet".
- **`STOP` was truncated** by an immediate `furi_hal_serial_deinit`, so the
  board kept scanning after the app closed.
- **Restarting a hunt silently wiped the session.** It is now an explicit
  `Clear detections`; only switching between real and simulated wipes.
- **A tracker seen twice, minutes apart, could be graded a follower.** The
  dwell clock now restarts after 30 s of silence, which removes the app's worst
  false positive.
- **Stale records sat on the dial forever.** The radar shows what is around you
  *now*; the list keeps the history.
- **2.1 KB of stack** on the GUI thread in each of three scene handlers, from a
  local `TrackerRecord[48]`. Now one shared heap buffer.
- **The fourth list row was drawn off-screen** (4 rows × 13 px from y=13 ends
  at 65 on a 64-row display), and three help lines overflowed 128 px.
- **The alert strobed at 10 Hz**, full-width — unpleasant, and squarely in the
  flicker band photosensitive people are warned about. Now 2.5 Hz.
- **Samsung classification matched company ID `0x0075`**, which is on every
  Samsung phone, watch, TV and pair of earbuds — reporting half a train
  carriage as SmartTags. Only the SmartThings Find service UUID is used now.
- **Apple Find My is now split by its length byte**, so a *separated* tag (the
  stalking case) is graded differently from one whose owner is standing there.
- `application.fam` set explicit `sources=`; the recursive glob pulled a stray
  `__pycache__` into the link step.
- CI builds **both** firmware lines and verifies the API version baked into
  each artifact, instead of shipping one build that warns on half of all
  installs.

### Changed

- **The radar no longer draws a crosshair.** A cross through the middle reads
  as N/E/S/W, and GhostTag has no compass and no antenna array. The rings stay,
  because range is real; the angle is a stable hash of the address and the help
  screen says exactly that.
- **"following you" → "travelling with you".** Time in range is the only thing
  measured — there is no GPS and no route matching — so the screen reports what
  it saw rather than what it suspects.
- The detections list shows **dwell time**, which is the number that decides
  the verdict, and the detail screen shows **peak RSSI**, which was recorded
  and never displayed.
- New banner, social card, marks and README.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-24

- Initial release: radar view, detections list, per-device detail, alert
  screen, settings, the "following you" heuristic, and the ESP32 companion
  firmware with its plain-ASCII UART protocol.
