"""Capture real GhostTag screens and recordings off a Flipper Zero over serial RPC.

Every picture in this repository comes from the device. Mockup renderers are a
second implementation of the UI that can - and elsewhere in this family of apps,
did - disagree with the firmware while looking perfectly convincing. A capture
cannot.

    python3 tools_screenshot.py --all        # drive GhostTag, capture every screen
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --shot NAME  # grab whatever is on screen now
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --record N   # animated GIF of the live screen
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --tour-gif   # one GIF of a scripted walk
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --splash     # the boot intro, from launch onwards
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --sheet      # rebuild images/screens{,-dark}.png
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --catalog    # refresh screenshots/ssN.png aliases
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --verify     # assert every shot is two colours

The Flipper's CLI has no screenshot command on current firmware, but the
protobuf RPC session exposes the framebuffer and an input injector, so this
drives the app and grabs frames from the device itself.

Only four message shapes are needed, so the protobuf is encoded by hand rather
than pulling in a generated stub. From flipper.proto:

    Main { command_id = 1, command_status = 2, has_next = 3, oneof content }
      16 = App.StartRequest { string name = 1, string args = 2 }
      19 = StopSession {}
      20 = Gui.StartScreenStreamRequest {}
      21 = Gui.StopScreenStreamRequest {}
      22 = Gui.ScreenFrame { bytes data = 1 }
      23 = Gui.SendInputEventRequest { key = 1, type = 2 }

GhostTag needs no ESP32 board to be photographed: the app ships a Demo mode that
synthesises a scripted stalking scenario on-device, and every screen it paints
is stamped DEMO. The tour drives that, so these captures are of real firmware
drawing real frames - the tracker data behind them is simulated, and the screens
say so themselves.

Screens are written at 4x (512x256) in the device's own two colours, which is
both what the Flipper Apps Catalog accepts and what the branding rules require.
