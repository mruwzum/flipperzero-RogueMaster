/**
 * Tracker taxonomy + BLE advertisement signatures.
 *
 * The Flipper's stock BLE stack is peripheral/advertising only and cannot scan
 * - furi_hal_bt exposes advertising and RF test mode, but no GAP observer role
 * and no way to decode an advertisement - so the raw parsing happens on a
 * BLE-capable ESP32 companion (see esp32/ghosttag_esp32). The ESP32 classifies each advert and streams a single
 * digit TrackerType code to the Flipper over UART. The signatures below are the
 * contract both sides agree on and are documented here for reference.

 * Samsung SmartTag : service data UUID 0xFD5A (SmartThings Find) ONLY.
 *                    Company ID 0x0075 is Samsung Electronics and is on every
 *                    Samsung phone, watch, TV and pair of earbuds in the room,
