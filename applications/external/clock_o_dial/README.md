## Features

12-hour analog dial showing actual time of day, tracking elapsed work time, breaks, and a prediction of how much of your shift is left.
Hourly chimes, vibro, always-on backlight (everything is optional), **highly optimized** as a full-time running app.

## Controls

**Setting up a shift** (before you start):
- **Left / Right** - adjust the configured shift length (1-12 hours)
- **Up / Down** - switch the time format between `H:MM` and `H:MM:SS`
- **OK** (tap) - start the shift
- **OK** (hold) - open the info and options
- **Back** (hold) - close the app

**While working or on a break:**
- **OK** (tap) - pause / resume
- **OK** (hold) - reset back to the shift-setup screen
- **Up** - toggle mute
- **Down** - toggle backlight
- **Left** - toggle vibration
- **Right** - toggle eco mode
- **Back** (hold) - close the app

**Info and options screen:**
- **Left / Right** - cycle between pages
- **Back** - return to the shift-setup screen

## About the optimization

As an app made to run at least a third of the day, it is highly optimized, buffering every heavy calculation needed for rendering.
Rendering runs at one screen refresh per second when animation is active, or two refreshes per minute in eco mode.

My personal tests show it runs on my Flipper Zero with very little overhead.
Here are some battery drain stats for a **9-hour** time period:
- Nothing is running: **-2%** (for reference)
- In eco mode without backlight: **-3%**
- In normal mode without backlight: **-4%**
- With backlight active: **-11%**

So, basically, the app itself adds about **1–2%** drain for a full working day.

## Building from source

This is a Flipper Zero external app (FAP), built with [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt):

```bash
pip install ufbt
ufbt
```

To build and immediately launch it on a connected Flipper:

```bash
ufbt launch
```

Or simply connect the Flipper Zero to your machine and run `launch_app.sh`.
