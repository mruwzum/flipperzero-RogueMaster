"""Render Faraday's brand assets: banner (light + dark), social card, and mark.

THE SHIELD
----------
Faraday measures how much of a signal a pouch keeps OUT, so the artwork is
built on the same idea: a field on one side of a boundary and nothing on the
other. Paper is the measured side - a grade is something you write down and
hand to someone. Black is the sealed side.

Two laws, both enforced below rather than merely intended. They are inherited
from this family of repositories because they are what stops a brand asset
from quietly lying about the product.

  LAW 1, THE ORANGE QUARANTINE. EMBER (#FE8A2C) is never a stroke this file
  draws. It is not a chosen colour: every capture in screenshots/ is exactly
  two colours, (254,138,44) and (0,0,0), so it is literally the value the
  device emits. The only ember on any asset is light the device actually
  emitted - pixels inside a real capture, pasted untouched at an integer
  scale. _guard() raises if EMBER reaches a draw call.

  LAW 2, THE ACCENT MEANS ONE THING. The accent family draws MEASUREMENT and
  nothing else - never a rule, a frame, a margin, a mount or a word. There are
  no gold words anywhere in this system. text() raises if an accent token is
  passed as a text fill. The banner therefore carries exactly one
  accent-coloured object, and that object is the instrument's own scale.

Nothing here is typed that could be read: the version comes from faraday_i.h,
the grade thresholds come from helpers/fdy_grade.h, the lock threshold comes
from the Sub-GHz scene, and the device screen is a real capture.
