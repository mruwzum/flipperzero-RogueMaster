"""Capture real Flipper Zero screens and recordings from Faraday, over RPC.

Every picture in this repository comes off the device. There is no mockup
renderer any more: a drawing of a screen is a second implementation of the UI
that can - and elsewhere in this family of apps, did - disagree with the
firmware while looking perfectly convincing. A capture cannot.

    python3 tools_screenshot.py --all        # drive Faraday, capture every screen
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --probe      # what is on the screen right now
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --shot NAME  # save the current screen as NAME
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --record NAME --seconds 6
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --splash     # the launch intro (GIF + still)
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --tour-gif   # one GIF of a scripted walk
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --sheet      # rebuild images/screens{,-dark}.png
    python3 tools_screenshot.py --catalog    # refresh screenshots/ssN.png aliases

The Flipper's CLI has no screenshot command on current firmware, but the
protobuf RPC session exposes the framebuffer and an input injector, so this
drives the app and grabs frames from the device itself. Only a handful of
message shapes are needed, so the protobuf is encoded by hand rather than
pulling in a generated stub. From flipper.proto:

    Main { command_id = 1, command_status = 2, has_next = 3, oneof content }
      16 = App.StartRequest { string name = 1, string args = 2 }
      19 = StopSession {}
      20 = Gui.StartScreenStreamRequest {}
      21 = Gui.StopScreenStreamRequest {}
      22 = Gui.ScreenFrame { bytes data = 1 }
