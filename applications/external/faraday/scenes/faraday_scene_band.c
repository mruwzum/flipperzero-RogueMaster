 * A fob does not transmit continuously - it sends short bursts with gaps
 * between them - so the question is not "is the carrier there" but "did we
 * happen to be listening on the right band while a burst was going out".
 * Measured across one session at 400 ms, the SAME fob on the SAME band read
 * -90, -67, -52, -84, -60 and -31 dBm on successive passes: the sweep was
 * regularly landing entirely inside a gap, and the scan then reported no fob.
 * 500 ms is long enough to cover a typical burst interval. */

/* A band is only called when it is BOTH loud in absolute terms AND clearly
 * ahead of the runner-up. Both conditions are measured, not guessed, and
 * neither works alone:
 *
 *   - A LEAD test alone is fragile wherever a band carries real ambient
 *     traffic. Measured in one room: with no fob pressed, 315 MHz read -76 dBm
 *     against -90 on the other three, a 14 dB lead from tyre sensors and
 *     garage doors. Raising the lead threshold past that then broke the real
 *     case, because the same room's 315 ambient is the runner-up a genuine
 *     433.92 fob has to beat - a fob at -60 led by only 18 dB.
 *
 *   - An ABSOLUTE test alone would call a band on any nearby transmitter,
 *     which is exactly what 315 MHz ambient is.
 *
 * Together they separate the two cleanly: ambient fails the absolute bar, and
 * a fob held against the Flipper (-60 dBm and up) clears both comfortably.
 * Saying "no fob heard" is always available; naming the wrong band is not
 * recoverable, because every later measurement is then taken against noise. */
