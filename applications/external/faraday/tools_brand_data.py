"""Facts the branding is allowed to state, taken from the source rather than typed.

The banner in this repository shipped a stale version number once already,
because it was a string in a drawing script. Nothing here is typed that could
be read instead:

  * The version comes from faraday_i.h, the header the firmware compiles.
  * The grade thresholds come from helpers/fdy_grade.h, the same #defines the
    grading engine branches on - so the scale drawn on the banner is the scale
    the app actually applies, and a threshold change cannot leave the artwork
    quietly describing an older build.
  * The device screen on the banner is a real capture out of screenshots/,
    pasted untouched. It is not a drawing of the UI: a drawing is a second
    implementation that can disagree with the firmware while looking
    convincing.
