/**
 * Faraday - the measurement screen.
 *
 * One radio-agnostic view drives the whole test. It renders three faces:
 *   - Baseline  : live signal meter while you capture the open-air reference.
 *   - Shielded  : same meter while you capture the pouch-sealed level.
 *   - Verdict   : before/after comparison bars, the attenuation figure and a
 *                 letter grade.
 * The owning scene fills a MeterData each tick; the view knows all the on-screen
 * copy so both the Sub-GHz and NFC flows share pixel-for-pixel presentation.
