// Spyfall: everyone shares a location and a role there except one spy, who is told
// neither. The round is driven by players PRESSING buttons -- "I know the location"
// (spy only) and "I know the spy" (everyone, spy included) -- and the six-minute clock
// is only the fallback: running it out starts a round-robin nomination the table still
// has to win. This test drives the real engine through each of those paths and pins:
//   * the card stage: the clock does not start until every phone has tapped OK;
//   * exactly one spy per round, and the spy rotates between rounds;
//   * the location NEVER reaches the spy before the reveal, in any stage (the only
//     location text in their payload is the pack's full candidate list, identical every
//     round, which therefore carries nothing);
//   * a role only ever reaches its own holder;
//   * "I know the spy": right ends the round, wrong locks that player out for the round
//     while play carries on;
//   * "I know the location": right and wrong both end the round;
//   * the round-robin nomination: a poll short of the threshold passes the turn on, a
//     poll that clears it settles the round either way, and the spy wins outright once
//     every seat has nominated in vain;
//   * scoring: every outcome is worth exactly 1 point.
