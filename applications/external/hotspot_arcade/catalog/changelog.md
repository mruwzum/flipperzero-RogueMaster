## 1.8.0

- Four new games, twenty in all. Fill the Blank: a prompt with a gap, everyone answers
  from a hand of cards, a rotating judge picks the funniest. Werewolf: hidden roles,
  night and day, with a seer and a doctor. Spyfall: everyone shares a secret location and
  a role there except one spy, who must blend in. Draw a Monster: everyone draws one panel
  of a creature blind, and the finished sheet arrives on the Flipper. Thanks to genkigenki.
- Fixes a freeze under load: hosting a busy session used to slowly run the board out of
  memory until the hotspot stopped serving pages and needed a power-cycle. The official
  ESP32-S2 board's spare PSRAM is now used, so memory stays healthy all session. Boards
  without PSRAM still need a further fix.
- Reconnecting keeps your score, even when the phone changes its Wi-Fi address.
- The phone game loads faster on a reload, and the Flipper dashboard now shows the board's
  free memory.

## 1.7

- New game: Secrets, the sixteenth (whole-group). Each round poses a yes/no question that
  everyone answers secretly, then everyone predicts how many of the group said yes — only
  the group total is ever revealed, never who said what.
- Players can now vote from their phones to switch the active game (a majority of the other
  players), with a "Back to Lobby" option too. A host pick stays instant and authoritative.
- Would You Rather ends with an agreement chart showing how closely the group aligned.
- More reliable hosting: the phone web app is now kept in the board's flash instead of RAM,
  so the hotspot no longer runs low on memory and drops connections as more phones join.
  Trivia and party packs also allow up to eight topics per game.
- Firmware v19.

## 1.6

- New game: Chess, the fifteenth. Full FIDE rules refereed on the board: castling, en
  passant, underpromotion, claimable draws (threefold repetition, 50-move rule) and
  automatic ones (fivefold, 75-move, dead position), with a 5-minute blitz clock per
  side — a flag fall loses unless no mate was possible. The final position stays on the
  result screen, and the phone keeps its screen awake during games.
- Firmware v17.

## 1.5

- The phone UI is fully localized: the host's language reaches every phone, with
  Brazilian Portuguese first and English as the fallback for anything untranslated.
  Content packs can ship per-language versions, placed in a language subfolder
  under each game's pack folder.
- Firmware v16.

## 1.4

- New game: Kiss Marry Kill. Each round a rotating chooser secretly labels three people
  (drawn from the pack) Kiss, Marry, and Kill; everyone else predicts the chooser's
  assignment. Points for matching positions, and the chooser scores by how well the group
  reads them. Six rounds, four content packs. Thanks to genkigenki for contributing it.
- Firmware v15.

## 1.3

- New game: Spectrum, a Wavelength-style guessing game. Each round one player is the
  psychic: they see a hidden target on a 0-100 spectrum between two opposing words and type
  a clue; everyone else slides a dial to guess where it lands. Points by closeness, and the
  psychic scores by how well the group guesses, so a good clue pays off. Six rounds, four
  content packs. Thanks to genkigenki for contributing it.
- Firmware v14.

## 1.2

- Two new games, bringing the total to twelve.
- Guess the Color: a random color swatch appears; dial in its R/G/B with a slider per
  channel. Closest guess wins the round with a speed bonus, over five rounds. The reveal
  lines up everyone's guess beside the answer so you can see how close each was.
- Battleship: place a hidden fleet of five ships on a 10x10 grid, then fire at the enemy
  grid. A hit lets you fire again; sink all five ships to win.
- Firmware v13.

## 1.1

- Flash more than one ESP board: "Install Firmware" now opens a board picker for the
  official Flipper WiFi Dev Board (ESP32-S2), an ESP32 WROOM board, or an ESP32-C5 board.
  Each board's firmware is bundled, so it stays an offline, no-computer flash.
- One-click flashing: each board also has an "(auto boot)" option that drops the board into
  download mode on its own (no holding BOOT and tapping RESET). The manual option stays for
  boards wired differently. Thanks to xMasterX for this, the C5 support, and the flasher fixes.
- The flasher no longer freezes if you press Back while it is waiting for the board.
- Note: the first launch (and each update) can take up to 3 minutes while the app unpacks
  its bundled firmware and game files to the SD card. The hourglass is the loader working.
- Firmware v11.

## 1.0

- Four games are now driven by plain-text content packs: Trivia, Would You Rather,
  Word Scramble, and Draw & Guess. Six packs per game ship inside the app, and your own
  packs in the per-game folders under /ext/apps_data/hotspot_arcade/packs/ still take precedence.
- New angry reaction emoji. Reactions are scoped to the people sharing your screen and
  now show who sent them.
- Lobby chat appears on the Flipper's Console, so the host can follow the chatter.
- Boards render correctly in phone browsers, including on iOS/Safari (Reversi, Connect
  Four, Tic-Tac-Toe).
- Rematch after an opponent leaves returns you to the lobby, and you can't challenge
  someone who is still on their win/lose screen.
- A captive-Wi-Fi popup now points you to open the game in your real browser, where the
  multiplayer connection is reliable.
- Firmware v11.

## 0.3

- Everything ships inside the app: the phone game bundle and trivia packs are bundled
  alongside the ESP firmware, so there is no SD card setup at all.
- Your own trivia packs and web bundle still work: drop them in
  /ext/apps_data/hotspot_arcade/ and they take precedence over the bundled ones.
- Nicknames are shown in all caps everywhere, for consistency across the phones and the
  Flipper.
- Flashing the board continues on its own once it reboots, so tapping RESET is the only step.
- Firmware v7.

## 0.2

- Ten games: Trivia, Would You Rather, Word Scramble, Reaction Duel, Connect Four,
  Tic-Tac-Toe, Dots & Boxes, Reversi/Othello, Drawing & guessing, and real-time Pong.
- Pick an emoji avatar; send emoji reactions that float up on every phone.
- Flash the ESP board on-device from the Flipper (no computer needed).
- Firmware identity + versioning, so an outdated board is offered an update.
- Redesigned broadcasting dashboard; every game is phone-driven and self-organizing.

## 0.1

- Initial release: offline multiplayer Trivia and Connect Four hosted from the Flipper
  and the ESP32-S2 WiFi board, with a streamed phone game client.
