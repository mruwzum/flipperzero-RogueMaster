/*
 * A canvas that prints every call instead of drawing it.
 *
 * The screens are the one part of this game neither build can check
 * against the other by running tests, because a test can only say a
 * layout is in bounds, never that it is the agreed layout. A trace can:
 * dump both builds in this format and diff them.
 *
 * One thing a cross-build diff will always show, and it is not a bug.
 * Anything centred from a measured string can land a pixel or two off
 * between the two traces, because the width table below only
 * approximates the device font and the browser has its own metrics. The
 * pause screen's rule chip is the clearest case: it measures with
 * canvas_string_width and centres the result, so it self-corrects on
 * whatever font it actually renders in. Compare the shape of a trace,
 * not the last pixel of a centred x.
