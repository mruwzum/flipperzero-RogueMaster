# The device is a Cortex-M4F and the host is not, so where a bare-metal
# ARM compiler is available, build for the real target first. It is the
# only thing here that would catch a 32-bit or float assumption, and the
# undefined symbols it leaves are exactly what a .fap asks the firmware
# for at load time - so anything in that list beyond the Flipper API and
# a little libc is a symbol the app might not find on the device.
# The stubs only do their job while they say what the device's headers
# say. A drifted stub compiles perfectly here and then fails under ufbt -
# or worse, compiles there and behaves differently, the way an FS_Error
# read as a bool inverts every success test. Needs the network, so a
# failure to fetch is a skip and only a real mismatch is a failure.
# set -e would kill the script on a non-zero exit before the case below
# could report it, so take the status without tripping it
