// Net Guardian -> Right -> this list: pick the network the Guardian is guarding.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Untargeted, the Guardian answers "is anything around me under
// attack?". Left on a desk in a flat, an office or a hotel that is mostly somebody
// else's traffic, and the operator learns to ignore it -- the failure mode the
// fused score was built to avoid. Targeted, it answers "is MY network under
// attack?", which is the question someone leaving a Flipper by their router has.
//
// Only the NETWORK-shaped inputs are filtered (deauth attribution, evil twins).
// Flock, trackers, a Flipper nearby and attack-tool signatures are about the
// OPERATOR, so they keep contributing whatever the target is.
//
// THE LIST SCANS FOR ITSELF. It used to render "(no APs seen yet - run a scan)"
// when the table was empty, which was wrong twice over: the submenu clipped it to
// "(no APs seen yet - run a s..." so the instruction was cut off mid-word, and
// selecting the row did nothing anyway. A screen that tells you to go do something
// else, in a sentence you cannot finish reading, is worse than an empty screen.
// There is now a "Scan for networks" row that actually runs the sweep, and the
// list repopulates in place as results arrive.
