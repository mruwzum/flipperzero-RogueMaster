// The hold-OK action menu for one detection.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Coming back from a drive with two rows tagged and no memory of
// why either was tagged is not a usable record. A single anonymous "marked" bit
// cannot say "I got out and looked at this one" or "this turned out to be the
// neighbour's solar inverter". Confirming and naming are the two things that turn
// a list of guesses into ground truth, and ground truth is what promotes a
// candidate fingerprint out of the candidate table.
//
// WHY HOLD-OK. Tap-OK already opens the detail screen and Left is already Delete,
// both of which the operator uses constantly while driving. A long press adds the
// slower deliberate actions without taking a key away from the fast ones, and
// without a trip back to the main menu.
