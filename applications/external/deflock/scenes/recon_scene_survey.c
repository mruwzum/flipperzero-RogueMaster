//
// WHY THIS SCREEN EXISTS (issue #25). The detector only ever reports what it
// already recognises. Every modern Flock camera randomises its MAC, so it has no
// vendor prefix to match and it scores nothing -- and recon_app.c drops anything
// scoring FlockConfidenceNone before it reaches the hit table. The result, from a
// real report: a reporter drove past ten-plus cameras and the app stayed empty
// the whole time, which is indistinguishable from a broken board.
//
// The survey was already being collected and written to survey.csv. It was just
// never shown on the device, so the one thing that could have broken the deadlock
// was legible only afterwards, on a computer, to someone who knew what to look
// for. That is what this fixes: same data, on the screen, ranked the way a person
// reads it.
//
// AND IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO TEACH THE APP A RANDOMISED CAMERA. "Confirm: I saw
// it" lives on the detection list, which by definition a randomised camera never
// reaches -- so the self-learning added in v0.91 could not be pointed at the
// devices it was built for. Learning from a survey row closes that loop.
//
// NOT A DETECTION LIST. Nothing here enters the hit table, nothing is exported as
// a sighting, and no row claims to be a camera. A high rank means "this behaves
// the way a fixed installation behaves", which a busy access point also does. The
// operator supplies the ground truth by looking with their eyes.
