// One surveyed transmitter, and the one action worth offering on it: teach the
// app its probe fingerprint after looking at the thing with your own eyes.
//
// WHY LEARNING HAPPENS HERE. A fingerprint hashes the SHAPE of a probe request,
// not the address, so it still matches after a device rotates its MAC -- which is
// the only handle anyone has on a modern Flock camera. v0.91 added that learning
// step, but hung it off the detection list, and a randomised camera never reaches
// the detection list (recon_app.c drops FlockConfidenceNone). So the feature
// could not be aimed at the devices it was built for. This screen is where it can
// be.
//
// WHAT A LEARNED FINGERPRINT IS WORTH. It is capped at "Class?" and can never
// reach Confirmed on its own, because the operator's eyes are good evidence about
// a camera and no evidence at all about which row in a list produced which
// packet. Getting it wrong costs a weak lead, not a false camera -- and a
// commodity scan skeleton is refused outright, so the most likely mistake cannot
// be made at all.
