 * Flock Companion - universal ESP32 Wi-Fi sniffer for the Flipper Zero
 * "Recon Site Survey" app.
 *
 * Runs on ANY ESP32 board exposed to the Flipper UART (Marauder hardware,
 * ReksLab Tri-Board, bare WROVER/WROOM, Xiao ESP32-S3, DevKitC, ...).
 * Puts the radio in promiscuous monitor mode, hops channels 1-13 (plus the 28
 * 5 GHz channels on an ESP32-C5, which has a dual-band radio), and reports
 * frames that look like Flock Safety / ALPR surveillance gear (by OUI, by
 * phone-home probe behaviour, and by SSID naming) over the serial link in a
 * simple line protocol the Flipper parses.
 *
 * Detection method and OUI list are from the open-source counter-surveillance
 * projects (colonelpanichacks/flock-you, 0xXyc/flock-you-wifi-recon,
 * nitekry/nite-oui-collection) and the DeFlock community. Passive recon only --
 * no deauth, no injection.
 *
 * Build: Arduino IDE or arduino-cli with the esp32 core. Select your board,
 * set Serial baud to 115200. No extra libraries required.
 *
 * Line protocol (newline-terminated, ASCII), TX to Flipper:
 *   FLOCKCO,1                              banner / version on boot and on "ver"
 *   S,<frames>,<hits>,<ch>,<deauth_rate>   status, ~1 Hz (deauth/disassoc per interval)
 *   D,<mac>,<rssi>,<ch>,<type>,<conf>,<ssid>[,fp=<hex32>][,cls=a|x][,hid=1] detection
 *       mac : aabbccddeeff (lower hex, no separators)
 *       rssi: signed dBm
 *       ch  : 1-13 (2.4 GHz), or 36-177 (5 GHz, ESP32-C5 only)
 *       type: P=probe-req  B=beacon  R=probe-resp  O=other
 *       conf: 1=possible 2=likely 3=confirmed (ESP-side score)
 *       ssid: raw SSID with ',' and control chars stripped (may be empty)
 *       fp  : FNV-1a uint32 (8 lower-hex) of the probe's IE skeleton (B1) --
 *             a MAC-independent device-CLASS fingerprint; trailing field,
 *             older parsers ignore it. Only emitted for probe requests.
 *       cls : device class. 'a' = SoundThinking acoustic sensor, 'x' = Axon
 *             police equipment, 'g' = vendor-exclusive competitor gear (vendor
 *             known, kind not). Absent means ALPR camera, so the common case
 *             adds no bytes. The VENDOR is never sent -- the Flipper re-derives
 *             it from the MAC using its own copy of these tables. Trailing.
 *       hid : the AP beaconed WITHOUT an SSID (zero-length or all-NUL IE).
 *             Beacons/probe-responses only. An observation the Flipper reports
 *             but does NOT score -- hiding an SSID is also ordinary consumer
 *             router behaviour. Trailing, only emitted when true.
 *
 *       All three trailing key=value fields are optional and order-independent.
 *       Add one and you must also grow the field array in esp_parser.c.
 *   BLE,<addr>,<rssi>,<cat>,<company>,<name>[,<mfghex>][,rv=1][,sep=1]   BLE device

 *               7 Axon (SIG company id 0x034D, TASER International)
 *       mfghex: raw mfg-data hex (Flock 0x09C8 only) for serial decode; pure
 *               hex, no '='. Trailing, older parsers ignore.
 *       rv=1  : the device exposed a Raven-specific GATT service (0x3100-
 *               0x3500) -> positive acoustic-sensor (Raven) identification.
 *               Trailing, contains '=' so it's distinguishable from mfghex;
 *               only emitted when matched, older parsers ignore.
 *       sep=1 : an Apple Find My tracker advertised its separated-state payload.
 *               This is a protocol state marker, not proof of ownership or
 *               stalking; older parsers ignore it.
 *   DA,<bssid>,<ch>                        deauth/disassoc attack target (attributed)

 *              blespam     (Apple/Samsung/Google pairing-advert flood)
 *       value: the count/rate measured. New line; older app builds ignore it.
 *   LOC,<rssi>                             Locator: live RSSI of the active target
 *                                          (signed dBm), streamed while homing.

 *                                          channels the sweep now covers. On a

 * sketch did not compile for that target at all -- it died on BLEAddress. That
 * is not a build we forgot to publish; the silicon cannot do Bluetooth.
 *
 * On such a part this now builds as a WI-FI-ONLY companion: probe/OUI camera
 * detection works exactly as it does anywhere else, and the BLE half of Flock
 * detection is gone permanently. Worth saying out loud, because an operator on
 * a Wi-Fi-only board who finds nothing cannot otherwise tell "there was no
 * camera" from "this board cannot see half of them".
 *
 * CONFIG_BT_ENABLED / CONFIG_BLUEDROID_ENABLED come from sdkconfig.h, already
 * pulled in by Arduino.h above.

/* ---- Arduino-ESP32 core 2.x / 3.x compatibility ---------------------------
 *
 * Core 3.x (IDF 5.x) changed the BLE API in ways that break compilation
 * outright, not subtly. Reported by @h00die (issue #4) on core 3.3.11, which is
 * what a fresh Arduino install gets TODAY -- so before this shim, anyone
 * following our own README hit a wall of errors. Our CI pinned 2.0.17, so it
 * never saw any of it. A pin is not portability; it just hides the question.
 *
 * The three breaks:
 *
 *   1. BLEScan::start(secs, bool) returns BLEScanResults* in 3.x, by value in 2.x.
 *   2. getManufacturerData() / getName() / BLEUUID::toString() /
 *      BLEAddress::toString() return Arduino String in 3.x, std::string in 2.x.
 *   3. BLEAddress::getNative() returns const uint8_t* in 3.x, but uint8_t(*)[6]
 *      in 2.x -- so the 2.x code deref'd it once and 3.x gave back a single byte.
 *
 * Normalised to std::string here because the detection logic below does
 * substring work (find/rfind) that reads clearly in std::string and would have
 * to be rewritten for String. Conversion is LENGTH-PRESERVING on purpose:
 * manufacturer data is binary and can contain NUL bytes, so it is rebuilt with
 * the (pointer, length) constructor rather than treated as a C string -- a
 * strlen-style copy would silently truncate an advert at its first zero byte and
 * lose the Flock 0x09C8 payload we decode serials from.
 *
 * ESP_ARDUINO_VERSION_MAJOR is absent on very old cores; treat absent as 2.x.

 *
 * A 2.4-only companion CANNOT SEE a Flock uplink on 5 GHz -- not "sees it
 * weakly", cannot see it at all. The ESP32-C5 is the first Espressif part with a
 * 5 GHz radio, so on that chip we hop both bands.
 *
 * Gated on the SoC capability, not on a board name: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORT_5G comes
 * from the IDF's own soc_caps.h, so a classic ESP32/S3/C3 compiles exactly as
 * before and pays nothing (the 5 GHz table is not even emitted). Requires
 * Arduino core 3.x, which is where the C5 exists at all.
 *
 * Channel list is the 28 20 MHz channels the IDF enumerates for this radio
 * (esp_wifi_types_generic.h). Band switching is done purely by setting the
 * channel: the IDF docs say to prefer esp_wifi_set_channel() over
 * esp_wifi_set_band(), and it moves bands on its own once band mode is AUTO.
 *
 * COST, stated plainly: a full sweep goes from 13 channels to 41. At the same
 * 300 ms dwell that is ~12.3 s per sweep instead of ~3.9 s, so a given camera is
 * revisited a third as often. That is the honest price of covering a band we
 * currently cannot see, and `band 2g` returns the fast sweep for anyone who
 * wants it.

// ---- Sustained-probe-rate gate -------------------------------------------
//
// WHY. "Flock OUI + wildcard probe request -> LIKELY" is too generous on its own,
// because a wildcard probe is the most ordinary frame a Wi-Fi client emits: it is
// literally what scanning for a network looks like. And FLOCK_OUIS is mostly chip
// vendors, not Flock -- 21 of its entries are Liteon. So an ordinary consumer
// device built on the same silicon, doing nothing but looking for a network, was
// scoring LIKELY. A user reported exactly that for a T-Mobile hotspot.
//
// THE GATE THIS BUILT WAS REMOVED. Twice it was set to a value that could not be
// demonstrated to pass a camera, and a filter on the primary detection path that
// cannot be shown to pass a true positive is worse than the false positive it
// prevents. What remains is the COUNTER, reported as `pr=<n>`, so a future
// threshold can be derived from measurement instead of from reasoning.
//
// The reasoning was: a fielded camera sprays wildcard probes roughly every 125 ms
// while a phone emits a burst and goes quiet, so rate should separate them. The
// first attempt asked for 3 probes in 2000 ms, which the radio's own duty cycle
// makes impossible -- it watches one channel for 300 ms out of every 3900 ms, so
// a camera can only ever put 2 into one window. The second widened the window to
// span sweeps; on the bench that still produced zero probe-sourced detections
// while beacons from the same board detected fine, and whether the cause was the
// gate or the rig's MAC spoofing was never established.
//
// The reported false positive is addressed where it actually came from: 48:27:ea
// (Samsung) and a4:cf:12 (Espressif) are out of the built-in table.
//
// So: require several probes from the same transmitter inside a short window
// before OUI+probe may reach conf=2. Because the radio only watches any one
// channel for 300 ms at a time, a camera does NOT clear this inside a single
// dwell -- it clears it by still probing on the next sweep, which a phone that
// has finished scanning does not do. See the arithmetic on PROBE_WINDOW_MS.
//
// THRESHOLDS ARE NOT FIELD-TUNED. 125 ms is upstream's figure, but the client-side
// distribution has never been measured here, so these are deliberately loose --
// they are set to catch the reported false positive without risking a real
// camera, not to be optimal. The observed count is reported on the wire as
// `pr=<n>` precisely so it can be tuned from real captures instead of guessed at
// again. Widen the window or lower the threshold only with data.
#define PROBE_TRACK_N   24 // transmitters tracked (LRU); urban scans are busy
// THE WINDOW MUST SPAN SEVERAL CHANNEL SWEEPS. This is not a tuning preference,
// it is arithmetic, and getting it wrong once already shipped a gate that could
// never open:

//   so any one channel is watched for 300 ms out of every 3900 ms
//   a fielded camera probes every ~125 ms -> 300/125 = 2 probes seen per dwell
//
// v0.74 asked for 3 probes inside 2000 ms. A camera can only ever put 2 into one
// dwell, and consecutive dwells are 3900 ms apart, so two dwells never share a
// 2000 ms window. The threshold was unreachable BY CONSTRUCTION -- not strict,
// impossible -- and it silently disabled the OUI+probe path that finds most
// fielded cameras. Caught by tools/flock_emitter on the bench, which is exactly
// why that rig exists.
//
// What actually separates a camera from a phone at this dwell is PERSISTENCE
// ACROSS SWEEPS, not burst rate inside one. A camera in station mode is probing
// on every single visit, forever. A phone scanning emits a burst and then goes
// quiet for tens of seconds. So the window spans ~2 sweeps and the threshold is
// what a camera accumulates over them:
//
//   camera  ~2 per dwell x 2 dwells in 8000 ms = ~4  -> passes
//   phone    1-2 probes total in one burst          -> blocked
//
// STILL NOT VALIDATED AGAINST A REAL CAMERA. 125 ms is upstream's figure and the
// arithmetic above follows from it; nobody has held this against fielded
// hardware. The observed count rides the wire as `pr=<n>` so it can be measured
// rather than reasoned about a third time.
#define PROBE_WINDOW_MS 8000 // ~2 full channel sweeps, so persistence accumulates
// No PROBE_BURST_MIN any more: nothing GATES on this count. It is reported as
// `pr=<n>` and weighed by a human, which is the only honest use for it until
// someone measures a real camera against a real phone.
//
// VENDOR_PROBE_SUSTAINED is NOT that gate coming back, and the difference is
// the direction it fails in. The old one REJECTED: set too high, it threw away
// real cameras, which is how it came to be removed. This one PROMOTES a
// vendor-exclusive hit from "possible" to "likely" and nothing else. Set too
// high it simply never fires and the behaviour is exactly what it is today;
// nothing is lost, only not gained.
//
// It also only has to fire ONCE per device. Confidence is max-held per entry on
// the Flipper, so a camera that crosses the line on any single frame stays
// promoted, and the many frames where it lands low in the window do not undo it.
// That is what makes a conservative value safe rather than useless.
//
// 4 comes from the arithmetic above (a camera accumulates ~4 across two sweeps,
// a phone burst is 1-2) and matches what this bench shows: the sustained prober
// here reaches 6, 7 and 12 while a randomised-MAC phone sat at 1. STILL NOT

// a second vendor IE (00:50:f2 type 0x08) with payload 00 00 00. Two vendor
// elements with fixed payloads bracketing a specific capability pair is a far
// tighter claim than any one anchor alone.
//
// WHY A SUBSTRING AND NOT THE WHOLE TAG LIST. The elements BEFORE the first
// vendor IE are the ones a capture path is most likely to mangle -- a driver
// that mis-starts its IE walk, or trims a frame, loses the leading tags first
// and the tail last. Anchoring on the run that ends the probe means a signature
// still matches when the front of the list is damaged, and it costs nothing in
// precision because the discriminating content is all in that run.
//
// THE ANCHOR ALONE WOULD FALSE-POSITIVE, measured rather than assumed. Two
// ordinary devices on this project's bench carry the same Wi-Fi Alliance MBO
// element, one of them with the identical 03 01 03 payload:
//   1,50,3,45,191,221:0050f208002600,255,127,255,221:506f9a16030103

// Neither matches, because in both the MBO element sits at the END of the tag
// list while the signature requires it FOLLOWED BY 45,191 and the second vendor
// element. Matching the ordered run rather than the anchor is what keeps those
// two out, and it is why this is a substring of a sequence and not a keyword.
//
// SINGLE-SOURCE, so it is capped at Class? on the Flipper and can never

// ALPR cameras, nothing scoring. The radio is fine; nothing in the air matched
// any table we ship.
//
// The detector cannot explain that, because it only ever reports what it already
// recognises. A camera on an OUI we do not know, or one that has moved to MAC
// randomisation -- which this file's own comments warn "collapses the whole
// OUI/SSID ladder" -- is indistinguishable from an empty street.
//
// So this records what is ACTUALLY there: every distinct transmitter sending
// WILDCARD probe requests, matched or not, with its IE-skeleton fingerprint. Park
// next to a camera you can see, and the row with a large count and a stable
// fingerprint is the camera -- whatever its OUI turns out to be. That is how the
// OUI table gets extended and how flock_ie_fps[] finally gets populated, which is
// the designed answer to randomised MACs and currently ships empty.
//
// Wildcard probes only: a directed probe names a network the device already
// knows, which is ordinary client behaviour and would bury the table in phones.
// Phones still appear -- they scan too -- but a phone emits a burst and stops
// while a camera probes every ~125 ms forever, so COUNT is the discriminator.

    // they now emit wildcard PROBE REQUESTS roughly every 125 ms and do not
    // beacon (see the upstream flock-you research this OUI list comes from).
    // So an OUI hit on a BEACON is, by construction, not a camera. It is some
    // other product built on the same silicon.
    //
    // And this list is mostly shared silicon-vendor ranges -- Espressif, Liteon
    // and friends -- so "beacons, and has one of these OUIs" describes an
    // enormous number of ordinary consumer devices. It reported a T-Mobile
    // gateway (SSID "tmobile-5416") as a possible ALPR camera, which is exactly
    // the failure this project says it will not accept: a false positive is
    // worse than a missed detection.
    //
    // Nothing real is lost. Anything that IS a camera still reaches conf=2 via
    // the probe-request branches above, and conf=3 via an SSID name or IE
    // fingerprint. The only sightings dropped are OUI-only ones with no probe
    // behaviour and no name -- which is precisely the set that cannot be
    // distinguished from an unrelated device sharing a chip vendor.

    // A KNOWN COMMUNITY SIGNATURE IS A DETECTION IN ITS OWN RIGHT.
    //
    // Every rung above needs an OUI match or a Flock SSID, so a camera on a
    // RANDOMISED address scored 0 and was dropped right here -- before the
    // fingerprint was even computed. That is the structural reason a camera an
    // operator was parked in front of stayed invisible through issue #25, and no
    // amount of fingerprint curation fixes it while this return sits in front of
    // the fingerprint.
    //
    // The score is NOT raised here. conf stays whatever the ladder decided,
    // possibly 0, and the match travels as `sg=1` for the Flipper to weigh:
    // conf=3 on this wire means CONFIRMED, and a single-source community
    // signature must never auto-confirm. helpers/esp_parser.c caps it at

 * talk". It does not answer "which firmware is on this board", and until now
 * nothing did: the only label a flashed companion had was the filename of the
 * .bin somebody picked on the SD card, which cannot be verified after the fact
 * and is routinely wrong. One card here held companion_forensic.bin,
 * companion_gatefix.bin, companion_survey.bin and companion_ungated.bin -- none
 * of which say which build they are -- alongside companion_v073/v077/v087, whose
 * labels nobody can check.
 *
 * That is not cosmetic. A whole hardware validation session was run against a
 * companion nobody could identify, and the app's CLAUDE.md carries a HARD RULE
 * about the same failure on the Flipper side (redeploy after a version bump,
 * because the .fap reports the old version while running the new code). This is
 * that rule's missing half.
 *
 * MUST equal FAP_VERSION in application.fam: the two halves are built, flashed
 * and tested as a pair, and a companion left over from a different release is
 * precisely what this exists to expose. tools/check_oui_parity.py fails CI if

 * `rx > 0 && rx != 1 && rx != 3 && rx < 48`, which is the classic ESP32's
 * pinout written as if it were universal. On an ESP32-C5 that is wrong three
 * separate ways, and the failure modes get worse as they go:
 *
 *   - GPIO32..35 were offered by the app and do not exist (C5 stops at 28).
 *   - GPIO16..22 are the flash/PSRAM bus. A C5-WROOM-1-MDN8R8 has 8 MB of each,
 *     so they are genuinely occupied. This is what a user was told to use.
 *   - UART0 is GPIO11/12 on a C5, NOT 1/3. So the one thing the guard existed to
 *     prevent -- taking the link to the Flipper and cutting the board off, which
 *     needs a recovery flash to undo -- was exactly what it failed to prevent.
 *
 * Deriving the bounds from the SOC_, SPI_IOMUX_ and U0xxD_GPIO_NUM macros means
 * this is automatically correct on parts nobody here has ever held.
