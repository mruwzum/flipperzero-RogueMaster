Fail if any first-party file is missing its licence header or attribution.

WHY THIS EXISTS. This project has already been copied wholesale once: a v0.41
snapshot was re-uploaded under the same name with no attribution. No DMCA route
existed, and the reason was documentation, not law -- the MIT-era LICENSE read
"Copyright (c) 2026 FlipDeFlock contributors" with no personal name, and the copy
reproduced it verbatim, so the notice requirement was satisfied. Per-file SPDX
headers only arrived with the GPL relicense, AFTER that copy was taken.

So the headers are not decoration. They are the thing that makes the next
verbatim re-upload provably a stripped derivative rather than an honest fork, and
one untagged file is a hole in exactly that argument. Five had drifted in before
this check existed, including the shipped companion firmware source.

Checked, per first-party source file:
  1. an SPDX-License-Identifier line, matching the project licence
  2. a copyright line naming the maintainer

lib/ is excluded: it is vendored third-party code (jsmn, qrcodegen,
esp-serial-flasher) that carries its own upstream notices, and rewriting those
would be the very thing this file exists to object to.

Usage:  python tools/check_provenance.py     (exit 0 = clean, 1 = gaps)
