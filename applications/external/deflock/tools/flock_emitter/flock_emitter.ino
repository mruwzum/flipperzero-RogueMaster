 * Flock Emitter - a BENCH TARGET for FlipDeFlock. NOT a detector.
 *
 * ############################################################################
 * # THIS SKETCH TRANSMITS. FlipDeFlock itself never does; this is a separate  #
 * # tool that exists only so the detector has something to detect. Run it on  #
 * # a bench, on a board you own, and turn it off afterwards. Do not run it    #
 * # where it could pollute someone else's capture or be mistaken for real     #
 * # surveillance hardware. See README.md in this folder.                      #
 * ############################################################################
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Everything in FlipDeFlock since v0.20 is compile-verified in
 * CI and has never been validated against a radio. The host tests prove the
 * scoring maths; the CI build proves it links. Neither proves that a frame on
 * the air becomes the right row on the Flipper's screen. That gap needs a
 * transmitter, and driving to a real ALPR pole to get one is a poor test loop:
 * you cannot ask a real camera to emit a Possible, then a Likely, then a
 * CONFIRMED, then a known false positive, on a 3-second rotation.
 *
 * So this board impersonates each rung in turn. Every identity below is chosen
 * to land on exactly one branch of the ladder in helpers/flock_db.c and
 * helpers/esp_parser.c, INCLUDING the branches that must NOT fire. If the
 * Flipper shows something other than the "expect" column, that is a real bug.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WiFi identities (beacons rotate every WIFI_ROTATE_MS; probe identities
 * hold for PROBE_HOLD_MS so they outlive a detector channel sweep)
 *
 *   # Identity                          Expect on the Flipper
 *   0 Flock OUI, beacon, named SSID      p Possible   (OUI only)
 *   1 Flock OUI, wildcard probe-req      L Likely     (OUI + probe behaviour)
 *   2 SSID "Flock-A1B2C3"                ! CONFIRMED  (anchored provisioning name)
 *   3 SSID "test_flck"                   ! CONFIRMED  (CVE-2025-59409 dev SSID)
 *   4 SSID "Flock-Guest"                 L Likely, NEVER Confirmed  <-- B6 guard
 *   5 SoundThinking OUI d4:11:d6         "ST" tag, Possible/Likely
 *   6 Flock OUI, beacon, zero-length IE  "[hid]" tag, rung unchanged
 *   7 Flock OUI, beacon, all-NUL IE      "[hid]" tag, rung unchanged
 *   8 Ubicquia OUI 94:7b:be, beacon      p Possible, vendor "Ubicquia"
 *   9 Motorola Sol. 00:04:7d, beacon     p Possible, vendor "Motorola"
 *  10 Motorola MOBILITY 50:16:f4         NOTHING -- must never appear
 *  11 Motorola Solutions, wildcard probe L Likely, class Gear (v0.97 rung)
 *
 * Identities 8-10 cover the v0.77 vendor work, and 8 is the one that proves the
 * companion was reflashed: a bare named beacon from a vendor-exclusive OUI
 * scored conf=0 (i.e. was never reported) on every build before v0.77, so if it
 * shows up at all, the new rung is live. Check the detail screen reads
 * "Ubicquia streetlight" and NOT "Flock / ALPR camera" -- that label is the
 * whole point of the change.
 *
 * Identity 10 is the attribution guard. Motorola Mobility is Lenovo's consumer
 * phone business, a different company from Motorola Solutions, and a substring
 * search of the IEEE registry hands you both. If it is ever listed, a phone
 * prefix got into a table.
 *
 * Identity 4 is the important one, and it is not hypothetical: through v0.46 the
 * companion substring-matched "flock-", the Flipper took its score verbatim, and
 * Flock-Guest really did display as CONFIRMED. Both sides now anchor on
 * ^flock-[0-9a-f]{6}$ and the Flipper re-derives any claimed CONFIRMED from the
 * SSID it was sent. If the bench ever shows Flock-Guest as CONFIRMED again,
 * one of those two guards regressed.
 *
 * Identities 6 and 7 are the two legal hidden-SSID encodings, and the companion
 * detects them on DIFFERENT code paths (a zero length versus a byte scan for
 * all-NUL). The host tests cover the `hid=1` token, not the detection, so this
 * sketch is the only thing that ever exercises either branch.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Net Guardian test (serial-toggled, OFF by default):
 *   send "atk on" over serial  -> sustained beacon flood, Net Guardian ACTIVE
 *   send "atk off"             -> stop. Never collides with the Flock tables.
 *
 * BLE identities (rotates every BLE_ROTATE_MS)
 *
 *   0 mfg 0x09C8 + name "Penguin-1234567890"  FLOCK, serial decoded
 *   1 mfg 0x09C8 + name "FS Ext Battery"      FLOCK, model label not a serial
 *   2 Raven GATT service 0x3100            "Flock Raven (audio)"
 *   3 mfg 0x09C8, undecodable payload      CONFIRMED on the mfg id ALONE
 *   4 name "RWLS-38:5B:44:B3:0F:5A"      CONFIRMED by NAME alone
 *   5 name "FS-1A2B3C"                   CONFIRMED by NAME alone
 *   6 Remote ID (ASTM F3411)             DRONE, own class, + operator location
 *
 * Identity 6 is not a Flock device at all and must NOT come out as one: expect
 * class "Drone" / "Unmanned aircraft", serial BENCH-DRONE-01, and an OPERATOR
 * position about a kilometre from the aircraft position. It rotates Basic ID ->
 * Location -> System from a single address, exactly as a real aircraft does, so
 * it exercises the accumulate-across-adverts path rather than handing the
 * detector everything in one packet.
 *
 * 4 and 5 set name_only, so they carry NO manufacturer data and no service
 * UUID. That flag is the whole test: without it apply_ble_identity() attaches
 * the 0x09C8 company id to them and they are Confirmed before the name is
 * consulted -- which is what happened on their first run, against a companion
 * that had never heard of either name.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HARDWARE / LIMITS
 *
 *   - Any classic ESP32 (WROOM/WROVER). 2.4 GHz only, which is all FlipDeFlock's
 *     companion scans, so there is nothing this rig cannot reach.
 *   - Beacons are injected with esp_wifi_80211_tx() in AP mode. The ESP32 IDF
 *     refuses to inject frames whose source MAC is not one of the interface
 *     MACs UNLESS en_sys_seq is true and the frame is a valid mgmt frame; we
 *     hand-build the whole 802.11 header, so the spoofed OUIs go out as-is.
 *   - Probe requests are produced by esp_wifi_scan_start() in STA mode after
 *     setting the interface MAC, since the IDF will not inject a probe-req with
 *     a foreign address.
 *

 *   arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 tools/flock_emitter
