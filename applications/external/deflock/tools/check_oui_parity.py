Fail if the OUI tables in the Flipper app and the ESP32 companion have drifted.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The same two tables are compiled into two different binaries
built by two different toolchains:

    helpers/flock_db.c                     flock_ouis[] / soundthinking_ouis[] / axon_ouis[]
    esp32_companion/.../flock_companion.ino  FLOCK_OUIS[] / SOUNDTHINKING_OUIS[] / AXON_OUIS[]

There is no shared header -- the companion is an Arduino sketch that cannot
include the app's headers -- so both files carry a comment saying "keep these in
step by hand". Nothing enforced it. Editing one side alone silently desyncs
ESP-side scoring from the Flipper's, and the failure is invisible: detections
just quietly differ depending on which side saw the frame first.

A comment is not a guard. This is.

THREE CHECKS, because parity alone proved insufficient:
  1. Content parity  -- the two tables hold the same prefixes in the same order.
  2. Declared count  -- each file's own "(31)" comment matches its array length.
  3. Retracted list  -- no upstream-retracted prefix has come back.

(2) and (3) were added after f8:a2:d6 shipped in v0.67-v0.71: check (1) passed
throughout, because the commit that re-added it changed BOTH files identically
while both count comments still said 31. A check that only compares the two
copies to each other cannot see a mistake made in both.
