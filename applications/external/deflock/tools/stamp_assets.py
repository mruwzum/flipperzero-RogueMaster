Stamp authorship metadata into the image assets, without touching a pixel.

WHAT THIS DOES. Writes standard PNG `tEXt` keys (Author, Copyright, License,
Source, Software) and a GIF comment block. None of it renders -- the images are
byte-for-byte identical on screen -- but `exiftool`, `identify -verbose`, Pillow,
and most image tools will show it, and it travels with a file that is copied
rather than re-exported.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not tamper-proof and it is not a claim of one. Metadata
is trivially stripped by anyone who thinks to, and re-encoding drops it silently.
Its honest value is against CASUAL copying, which is precisely the case this
project has already met: a v0.41 snapshot re-uploaded verbatim under the same
name. A verbatim copy carries the metadata with it.

WHY THERE IS NO PIXEL WATERMARK. The obvious next idea is LSB steganography, and
for the two 1-bit assets it is not merely weak but actively harmful:

  asset_packs/.../frame_*.png   128x64, mode "1"
  icon.png                      10x10,  mode "1"

A 1-bit image has no least significant bit to hide in -- every bit IS the pixel.
Any payload flips visible pixels on a 128x64 monochrome LCD, corrupting the
animation the pack exists to ship. That trade is not worth making for a mark a
determined copier removes in one command.

The larger RGB assets (logo, thumbnail) could carry true LSB steg, but it would
not survive the resize, re-encode or screenshot that any reuse involves, so it
buys little over the metadata written here and costs a pixel diff nobody can
review. Provenance that actually holds up lives in the per-file SPDX headers
(tools/check_provenance.py), the published SHA256SUMS, and TRADEMARK.md.

Usage:  python tools/stamp_assets.py           # stamp everything
        python tools/stamp_assets.py --check   # verify, change nothing (CI)
