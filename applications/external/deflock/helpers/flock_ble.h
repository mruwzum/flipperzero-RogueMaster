 * @file flock_ble.h
 * Decoder for the Flock Safety external-battery BLE advert (mfg id 0x09C8,
 * XUNTONG). Extracts the always-on ASCII device serial and makes a CONSERVATIVE
 * model guess (Falcon ALPR vs Raven acoustic sensor).
 *
 * Pure logic, no firmware dependencies, so it can be unit-tested on a host.
 *
 * Sourced from open counter-surveillance research: ryanohoro's Falcon teardown
 * (the "TN7..." serial inside the XUNTONG mfg data, and the legacy
 * "Penguin-NNNN" / "FS Ext Battery" GAP name) and colonelpanichacks/flock-you.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the serial belongs to the *shared* external-battery unit that
 * Flock co-deploys on BOTH the Falcon and the Raven, so the advert ALONE cannot
 * split them. Raven IS now positively derivable from a DIFFERENT signal: the
 * Raven exposes acoustic-sensor-specific GATT services (0x3100-0x3500) that the
 * Falcon does not, surfaced by the companion firmware as a `raven_gatt` flag --
 * see flock_ble_model_ex() in flock_ble.c. Falcon, by contrast, is still NOT
 * derivable: there is no Falcon-specific tell, and absence of the Raven GATT is
 * NOT proof of Falcon (precision rule -- we never assert Falcon by elimination).
