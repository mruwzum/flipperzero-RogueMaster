 * @file flock_store.h
 * On-disk record format for persisted Flock/ALPR detections (`hits.csv`).
 *
 * Detections used to live only in RAM, so closing the app threw them away
 * (GitHub issue #2 -- two hits, back out to the Flipper menu, both gone). This
 * module is the format half: one detection <-> one CSV line, and the rule for
 * which stale entry to evict when the table is full.
 *
 * Pure (libc + the equally-pure report_escape / report_fmt helpers), no firmware
 * dependencies, so the round trip is host-testable. The file I/O that uses it
 * lives in recon_app.c next to the settings load/save.
