 * 32 OUI prefixes observed in fielded Flock Safety deployments.
 * Mostly @NitekryDPaul research; 82:6b:f2 from DeFlockJoplin field testing;
 * the last entry b4:1e:52 is Flock Safety's own IEEE-registered OUI (GainSec).
 * These are generic vendor prefixes (Liteon, Espressif, etc.), hence OUI-only
 * matches are scored "possible", never "confirmed".
 *
 * ADDED 2026-09-07 after a sweep of the current community tables, each prefix
 * resolved against the IEEE MA-L registry before acceptance (the memory rule:
 * verify by REGISTRY ORGANISATION NAME, never by the list it came from):
 *   e0:0a:f6  Liteon -- the same vendor as 21 of the entries below, so it is
 *             consistent with the module Flock actually buys. From plume tier 2.
 *   38:5b:44  Silicon Laboratories -- accepted because it is corroborated by a
 *             FIELD-OBSERVED BLE NAME rather than by a list: "RWLS-38:5B:44:B3:
 *             0F:5A", a Flock unit that appends its own MAC to its GAP name. We
 *             already carry three SiLabs prefixes (58:8e:81, ec:1b:bd, 90:35:ea).
 *
 * ADDED 2026-09-10, during a sweep of community prefix lists:
 *   14:b5:cd  LITEON TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, resolved against the IEEE MA-L
 *             registry before acceptance. Liteon is the vendor behind 21 of the
 *             entries already here, so this is the same module line Flock buys,
 *             not a new claim.
 * Two other prefixes circulating in those lists were re-checked and stay
 * REJECTED, for the reasons in the paragraph above: 48:27:ea is SAMSUNG and
 * a4:cf:12 is ESPRESSIF. TOO_GENERIC in tools/check_oui_parity.py is what keeps
 * a future sweep from quietly re-importing either one.
 *
 * REJECTED in the same sweep, and now ENFORCED by TOO_GENERIC in
 * tools/check_oui_parity.py so they cannot be quietly re-imported: 48:27:ea is
 * SAMSUNG (phones and hotspots -- literally the false-positive class a user
 * already reported), thirteen Espressif prefixes (chip vendor; they would make
 * this app detect its own companion board), f0:9f:c2 Ubiquiti, 8c:1f:64 and
 * 4c:6e:44 which belong to the IEEE Registration Authority itself (shared
 * MA-M/MA-S blocks -- a 3-byte match there names nobody), and d8:a0:d8 which is
 * not registered in MA-L at all. simeononsecurity/flock-finder ships 48:27:ea
 * and a4:cf:12; zmattmanz/plume ships all of the above. Widening recall from
 * those tables wholesale would cost precision, which the project rules forbid.
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH is now nitekry/nite-oui-collection ->
 * groups/flockers/my_tested_flock.md, a per-prefix table with Confidence and
 * Status columns. It SUPERSEDES the flat, statusless
 * colonelpanichacks/flock-you -> datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md list this
 * table was originally imported from -- the flat list cannot record that a
 * prefix was later doubted, so re-importing from it silently undoes retractions.
 *
 * RETRACTED UPSTREAM -- never re-add any of these: f8:a2:d6 ("low confidence;
 * hit on a Sony Media Player"), 6c:cd:d6 (Netgear), 94:2a:6f + f4:e2:c6
 * (Ubiquiti), cc:cc:cc (no hits), 00:0c:e7 (possible FP). The flat list still
 * carries some of them, which is exactly why re-importing from it is forbidden.
 *
 * f8:a2:d6 HAS BEEN REMOVED TWICE. Dropped 2026-07-27 for v0.44, then silently
 * re-added by 93beede (2026-08-05) -- a commit about TIGHTENING precision -- while
 * the table was reflowed, and it shipped in v0.67 through v0.71 scoring "Likely"
 * on any wildcard probe. Nothing caught it: the parity gate compared this table
 * against the sketch's and 93beede drifted BOTH sides identically, so 32-vs-32
 * passed while both count comments still said 31. That recurrence is why
 * tools/check_oui_parity.py now also checks the declared count and enforces a
 * retracted-prefix denylist, and why test_flock_db.c asserts each one is absent.
 * A comment is not a guard; treat the denylist as the real rule.
 *
 * This table is a claim of FIELD CORROBORATION. Uncorroborated candidates
 * belong in the user signature file, not here -- see docs/signatures.md.
 *
 * PROVENANCE GRADES. The rows below are NOT uniform evidence, and the ordering
 * is historical, so the grades are listed here rather than inline (the entries
 * would have to be reordered to comment them per row, and reordering both files
 * in lockstep is a worse risk than this list). Full table in docs/signatures.md.
 *   - Contract manufacturer (Liteon/USI), shared with unrelated consumer gear:
 *     f4:6a:dd, 00:f4:8d, d0:39:57, e8:d0:fc. WatchFlock files these separately
 *     from direct-Flock prefixes and warns a MAC match alone may be a FP.
 *   - Flat-list orphans, absent from the curated table in EVERY section (not
 *     Active, not testing, not Removed): 70:08:94, 58:00:e3, 5c:93:a2, 64:6e:69.
 *     Kept because absence is not retraction, but their status is unverifiable.
 *   - Weak upstream confidence: 08:3a:88 ("BLE Ring conflict - unsure"). Does
 *     NOT meet the field-corroboration bar this table's first line claims.
 * Nothing here changes scoring: an OUI-only match caps at "possible" regardless.
 *
 * DEMOTED to docs/signatures.seed.json (v0.73): 48:27:ea and a4:cf:12. Upstream
 * rates both "low confidence, WiGLE crowdsource" -- the weakest tier it has --
 * and the IEEE registry says 48:27:ea belongs to SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS and
 * a4:cf:12 to Espressif. Neither is Flock hardware; they are the chip vendors
 * inside a great many phones, tablets and hotspots.
 *
 * That mattered in the field, not just on paper. The companion scores
 * "Flock OUI + wildcard probe request" as LIKELY, and a wildcard probe is the
 * single most ordinary frame a Wi-Fi client emits -- it is what scanning for
 * networks looks like. So a Samsung-based T-Mobile hotspot doing nothing but
 * looking for a network was reported as a likely ALPR camera. Same failure as
 * the "tmobile-5416" gateway that killed bare-OUI-on-a-beacon scoring, one rung
 * up the ladder. A user reported it; that is what got these two demoted and the
 * probe-rate gate added on the companion side.
 *
 * Twenty-one of the prefixes below are registered to LITEON alone. Read the
 * table as "chip vendors Flock buys from", not "Flock devices" -- only
 * b4:1e:52 is registered to Flock Safety itself.
 *
 * DUPLICATED in esp32_companion/flock_companion/flock_companion.ino, which
 * scores ESP-side. No shared header is possible (that side is an Arduino
 * sketch), so change BOTH and keep the row layout identical -- EXACTLY four
 * entries per row -- so they can be diffed by eye. tools/check_oui_parity.py
 * enforces content parity as a required CI gate; the row layout is on you.

 * Axon Enterprise (formerly TASER International) police equipment.
 *
 * CORRECTED 2026-08-29 -- THIS TABLE USED TO MEAN "EQUIPMENT THAT MOVES".
 * Until v0.77 the comment here said Axon made body-worn and in-car kit and "not
 * fixed infrastructure at all", so a hit could never be a camera on a pole, and
 * the label said "body/in-car" to enforce that. In 2026 Axon launched Outpost
 * and Lightpost -- two FIXED, pole- and streetlight-mounted ALPR cameras, sold
 * into exactly the contracts cities were cancelling with Flock -- on this same
 * single OUI registration. The old claim is now wrong in the opposite direction.
 *
 * Nothing observable from a MAC separates an Axon Body camera from an Axon
 * Outpost, so the label no longer tries: it reads "Axon: body or fixed". Do not
 * "restore" the body/in-car wording; it is not a style choice.
 *
 * 00:25:df is Axon Enterprise's IEEE OUI registration -- the ONLY one they hold.
 * Verified directly against the IEEE registry, not taken from a list.
 *
 * DO NOT ADD PREFIXES BY SEARCHING A VENDOR DATABASE FOR "axon". That substring
 * also matches Axon NETWORKS Inc (00:58:28, 00:c0:d4, 84:70:03 -- an unrelated
 * networking company), Axona, Axonne, Interaxon, Maxon, Praxon, Paxonet and
 * Yaxon. Twelve unrelated registrants, none of them police equipment.
 *
 * NOR FROM A CURATED "LAW ENFORCEMENT" OUI LIST. One such list was checked
 * prefix-by-prefix against the IEEE registry and 11 of its 15 entries were wrong:
 * it attributed Apple prefixes to Digital Ally, Nintendo to WatchGuard, General
 * Motors and Samsung to Panasonic i-PRO, Xiaomi and Dell to Getac, and Axis
 * Communications to Flock Safety. Two of its three "Axon / TASER" prefixes are
 * really Honeywell Security and Nisca. Verify every prefix at the registry.
 *
 * FIELD STATUS: REGISTRY-VERIFIED, NEVER FIELD-OBSERVED. We have no capture of an
 * Axon device using this prefix on the air. Embedded products frequently expose
 * the Wi-Fi MODULE vendor's OUI instead of the brand owner's -- which is exactly
 * why most Flock hardware appears as Liteon or Espressif rather than b4:1e:52. So
 * this may match every Axon radio, or none of them. Scored accordingly: an
 * OUI-only hit caps at "possible", same as every other OUI in this file.
 *
 * DUPLICATED in esp32_companion/flock_companion/flock_companion.ino and covered

/*
 * ===========================================================================
 * VENDOR-EXCLUSIVE OUIs (15 across 7 vendors) -- competitor surveillance kit.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF EVIDENCE FROM flock_ouis[].
 *
 * flock_ouis[] is 29 prefixes of which 21 are LITEON and only one (b4:1e:52) is
 * registered to Flock Safety itself. It is a list of "chip vendors Flock buys
 * from", so a bare OUI hit there describes an enormous number of ordinary
 * consumer devices -- which is why bare-OUI-on-a-beacon scoring was removed
 * after it called a T-Mobile gateway a possible ALPR camera.
 *
 * Every prefix below is instead registered to the SURVEILLANCE VENDOR ITSELF.
 * 94:7b:be is Ubicquia's own registration and Ubicquia makes streetlight nodes
 * and nothing else. That is a categorically stronger signal than "this device
 * contains a Liteon radio", and it is why these may score on a bare beacon
 * (possible) where a flock_ouis[] hit may not. It is NOT strong enough to name
 * a product: see the class note on each table.
 *
 * ALL REGISTRY-VERIFIED, NONE FIELD-OBSERVED. Every prefix was read directly out
 * of standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt on 2026-08-29, one at a time, and the
 * organisation string is quoted verbatim on each table. We have no capture of
 * any of this hardware on the air. Embedded products routinely expose the Wi-Fi
 * MODULE's OUI rather than the brand owner's -- which is exactly why most Flock
 * gear appears as Liteon -- so these may match every unit of a product line, or
 * none of it. Scored accordingly: OUI-only never exceeds "possible".
 *
 * DO NOT ADD PREFIXES BY SUBSTRING-SEARCHING A VENDOR DATABASE. That rule is not
 * theoretical here; two of the vendors below are live traps:
 *   - "genetec" also matches GENETEC Corporation (00:0a:b1), an unrelated
 *     Japanese company, and Netgenetech (d8:c0:68). Neither is Genetec Inc.
 *   - "motorola" also matches Motorola Mobility LLC, a Lenovo Company
 *     (50:16:f4, c4:a0:52, c8:58:95 and more) -- consumer PHONES, a different
 *     company from Motorola Solutions. Including one would repeat the
 *     48:27:ea / a4:cf:12 failure on a far larger population.
 * Verify every prefix at the registry, by organisation name, before adding it.
 *
 * NOT ADDABLE AT ALL, so nobody re-researches this: Rekor, Vigilant, PlateSmart,
 * Altumint, LiveView, RedSpeed, Verra Mobility, Getac, Digital Ally and
 * Panasonic i-PRO hold NO IEEE registration -- they buy their hardware. Any list
 * claiming an OUI for them is fabricating it. (SoundThinking does hold one, but
 * under its old name ShotSpotter, and it is already in soundthinking_ouis[].)
 *
 * DUPLICATED in esp32_companion/flock_companion/flock_companion.ino, same
 * hand-sync rule and the same tools/check_oui_parity.py gate as the three tables
 * above -- EXACTLY four entries per row so the two files diff by eye.

 * with Flock -- is built with Ubicquia and mounts in the NEMA photocell socket
 * of an existing streetlight. The Ubicquia UbiHub it is based on is a triband
 * Wi-Fi 6 access point (the AP/AI variant adds dual 4K cameras and LPR), so
 * unlike a Flock camera -- which stopped beaconing around December 2025 and now
 * only probes -- this hardware is expected to BEACON CONTINUOUSLY. If that holds
 * in the field it is a considerably easier detection than Flock itself.
 *
 * CLASS IS Gear, NOT Alpr, and that is deliberate: a UbiHub AP6 is public Wi-Fi

 * ALSO EXCLUDED as look-alikes: 4c:48:da and 00:1f:64 are "Beijing Autelan

 * 0x42D75CD1 -- probe IE skeleton of a Flock camera on OUI 70:C9:4E, reported by
 * @h00die 2026-09-02 (false-positive report rows 5 & 6, two channels, one unit he
 * visually confirmed standing next to it). Points in its favour: it appeared on
 * that camera's OUI ONLY and did not smear across unrelated vendors the way the
 * generic 0x7C923B53 skeleton did. Still one operator, one camera, one drive --
 * hence candidate, not verified. Needs a second independent sighting to promote.
 *
 * 0xBA9FAFA0 -- the randomised-MAC signature this whole investigation has been
 * chasing since issue #25, from @wiilover22's 2026-09-11 drive.
 *
 * FOUR devices carry it, every one on a locally administered address, so no OUI
 * table can ever touch them -- which is precisely the case that made his
 * cameras invisible for three weeks. What promotes it above a guess is the
 * GEOGRAPHY: the four are 1.1 km to 6.1 km apart, so they cannot be one device
 * rotating its address, and they cannot be something riding in his car. Four
 * separate fixed installations along a road he reports as having 4-6 cameras.
 * Each is close and busy (-21 to -43 dBm, 28 to 133 probes in one session),
 * which is what a pole-mounted unit looks like and is not what a passing phone
 * looks like. It also recurs across FOUR of his six sessions and appeared in his
 * earlier 2026-09-08 capture, and it has never once been seen on this project's
 * bench.
 *
 * INDEPENDENTLY CORROBORATED, 2026-09-11, and this is the part that is not our
 * own reasoning. Cross-referencing the reporter's own coordinates against the
 * public OpenStreetMap surveillance layer (`man_made=surveillance`, the data
 * the community maps are built from) puts a mapped Flock Safety ALPR 44 m from
 * one of these devices, the one at -31 dBm with 62 probes. Of all EIGHTEEN
 * geotagged detections in that capture, that is the ONLY one within 100 m of a
 * mapped camera, and a second sits at 218 m. The nearest 0x89C3DEBF device is
 * 239 m away and was heard at -96 dBm, i.e. nowhere near the pole.
 *
 * Held at CANDIDATE anyway, for two honest reasons. Two of the four devices are
 * 1.7 km and 2.7 km from anything mapped -- explainable by patchy coverage, but
 * unexplained is not corroborated. And a map record is not a second radio
 * CAPTURE, which is what the promotion bar above actually asks for. Promotion
 * would also buy almost nothing in practice: these addresses are randomised, so
 * there is no OUI underneath for a built-in to auto-Confirm against.
 *
 * 0xD0BBEC4C -- the same drive, and the one hash here with a VENDOR ANCHOR.
 * Three devices, all three on OUIs already in flock_ouis[] above, spanning TWO
 * different Flock prefixes (24:B2:B9 and 70:08:94). Zero randomised addresses
 * and zero other-vendor addresses carry it. Two of the three sit 14 m apart,
 * which reads as two poles at one intersection. This is the shape the
 * fingerprint table was designed around: the hash and the OUI agree without
 * anyone having to judge which row was the camera.
 *
 * Both stay CANDIDATES despite the strength, because both come from one
 * operator on one road. A candidate lifts a detection to Class? and can never
 * auto-Confirm, which is the honest ceiling for that. Note 0xD0BBEC4C would
 * Confirm on sight if promoted, since it rides on a Flock OUI -- which is the

/**
 * KNOWN-GENERIC probe skeletons. Never a signature, at any tier. See
 * flock_ie_fp_is_generic() in the header for the rationale.
 *
 * ENTRY REQUIREMENT: documented in-repo provenance, and evidence the hash
 * appears on hardware that is NOT surveillance gear. "It looked noisy" is not
 * enough -- the whole point is that these are hashes which look COMPELLING in a
 * field report and are still worthless.
 *
 * 0x96FCD1B2 -- a plain ESP32 running a stock wildcard scan. This project's own
 *   bench emitter (tools/flock_emitter) produces it, so its identity is not in
 *   doubt: we built the transmitter. It also surfaced on FOUR different
 *   randomised MACs around wiilover22's first camera in issue #25, which is
 *   exactly the "one device rotating its address" pattern that makes a
 *   fingerprint look like a find. It is an ordinary scan, and shipping it would
 *   match phones and ESP32 IoT devices on every street.
 *
 * 0x173D7A70 -- almost certainly a common phone WiFi stack. Seen on FOUR
 *   locally administered MACs across THREE channels in a single short capture on
 *   this project's own bench (CANDIDATES.md, 2026-09-08) with no camera anywhere
 *   near it. Same seductive shape as the above, same answer.
 *
 * 0x7C923B53 -- the generic skeleton that SMEARED ACROSS UNRELATED VENDORS in
 *   @h00die's 2026-09-02 false-positive report, which is what disqualified it
 *   there while 0x42D75CD1 from the same capture survived as a candidate. It was
 *   already named in the flock_ie_fps_candidate[] comment above as the
 *   counter-example; this makes that judgement enforceable instead of advisory.
 *
 * 0x89C3DEBF -- RETRACTED, and it was OURS. This is the hash this project told
 *   @wiilover22 to put in his signatures.json on 2026-09-08 as "the device I
 *   think is the camera ... matches nothing else". His 2026-09-11 drive settles
 *   it: TEN devices carrying it, spread from 0 to 7.9 km apart, at signals from
 *   -17 to -96 dBm and probe counts from 1 to 149. A fixed camera is not in ten
 *   places at once across eight kilometres. It had also already appeared on
 *   EIGHT randomised MACs on this project's own bench with no camera present
 *   (CANDIDATES.md, 2026-09-09), which is what first put it in doubt.
 *
 *   Denylisting is the ONLY thing that undoes the advice, because
 *   flock_ie_fp_match() consults this list before the user's own file: his card
 *   goes inert on upgrade without him editing anything. Ten of the nineteen
 *   rows in the hits.csv he sent were phones matched on this hash.
 *
 * 0xC59C341F -- 24 distinct locally administered MACs across two sessions, one
 *   probe each, best signal -78 dBm (same capture). Twenty-four addresses seen
 *   once apiece is a street full of phones randomising, not a device. Carried in
 *   CANDIDATES.md as a watch item since 2026-09-09; the MAC count settles it.

/*
 * flock_score() USED TO LIVE HERE and was deleted in v0.48.
 *
 * It read like the canonical scorer and had a full test suite, but it had ZERO
 * production callers -- nothing on the device ever ran it. The shipped
 * combination logic is parse_flock() in helpers/esp_parser.c (companion backend)
 * and the inline block in esp_parse_generic() (Marauder backend), and those are
 * different code. So the tests that "covered scoring" were guarding a function
 * the product did not use, while the code that WAS used had no such guard.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: it is exactly how v0.46 shipped "Flock-Guest" as
 * CONFIRMED with every test green. Rather than leave a second, diverging ladder
 * around to be maintained and mistaken for the real one, the assertions moved to
 * esp_parse_companion_line() in test/test_esp_parser.c, where they exercise the
 * boundary the product actually uses.
 *
 * Do not reintroduce a standalone scorer here. If you need combination logic,
 * put it where the caller is, and test it through the wire protocol.
