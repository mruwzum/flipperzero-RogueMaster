# Updatable signatures (`signatures.json`)

FlipDeFlock ships a trusted, compiled-in detection database (OUIs, SSID patterns,
and — empty by default — probe IE fingerprints). You can **add** to it in the field
without rebuilding by dropping a JSON file on the Flipper's SD card at:

```
apps_data/flipdeflock/signatures.json
```

**Your file is never written to** (read once at app start), nothing is ever
networked, and it's **fail-safe**: if the file is missing, empty, malformed, or
oversized, the app silently falls back to the built-ins, so a bad file can't
break detection.

The app does write **one** file of its own, `learned.txt`, and only when you
explicitly confirm a detection. See [Learned fingerprints](#learned-fingerprints).

Two files ship in this folder, and they are not the same thing:

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| [`signatures.example.json`](signatures.example.json) | A **placeholder template**. Its values (`aa:bb:cc`, `deadbeef`, …) match nothing real — copy it and replace them with your own captures. |
| [`signatures.seed.json`](signatures.seed.json) | **Real but unverified** candidate prefixes, tracked upstream and not yet corroborated in the field. See [Seed signatures](#seed-signatures) below before you use it. |

## Learned fingerprints

`apps_data/flipdeflock/learned.txt` is written by the app, not by you.

When you use **Confirm: I saw it** on a detection you physically looked at, its
probe IE fingerprint is appended there. Next time that unit probes, it matches
again **even though its MAC has changed** — which matters because current Flock
cameras use randomised addresses, so the OUI tables never touch them. Six of the
seven devices in the first real field capture we got (issue #25) had locally
administered MACs.

Rules it follows:

- **Capped at "Class?"**, never Confirmed, exactly like a `signatures.json`
  fingerprint. Picking the wrong row out of a list of seven is easy, so a
  mis-confirmation has to cost a weak lead rather than a false camera.
- **Un-confirming does not unlearn.** Detection must not depend on whether
  somebody toggled a menu item twice. Forgetting is its own action:
  **Reports → Forget Learned**, which shows how many are stored and deletes the
  file.
- A fingerprint of `00000000` is never stored — that is the "no fingerprint
  captured" sentinel, and storing it would match every device that has none.
- Plain text, one 8-hex value per line, `#` comments ignored. It is a line file
  rather than JSON so that teaching the app one fingerprint is a single append
  instead of a read-modify-rewrite of the whole file.
- Bounded at 32 entries, the same cap as the JSON path.
- Nothing is transmitted. There is no sync, no upload, and no account. If you
  want a fingerprint to reach other people, send it to the issue tracker and it
  goes through the same corroboration every other signature does.

## Schema

All keys are optional; unknown keys are ignored. Every value is an array of strings.

```json
{
  "ouis":           ["aa:bb:cc"],
  "macs":           ["aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"],
  "ssid_confirmed": ["example-confirmed-ssid"],
  "ssid_likely":    ["example-likely-ssid"],
  "ie_fps":         ["deadbeef"]
}
```

| Key | Meaning | Scores at most | Cap |
|-----|---------|----------------|-----|
| `ouis` | MAC OUI prefix `aa:bb:cc` (case-insensitive) | **Possible** (OUI-only is weak) | 64 |
| `macs` | A **whole** address `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff` you pinned | **"Class?"** | 32 |
| `ssid_confirmed` | SSID substring that all but names a Flock unit | **Confirmed** | 32 |
| `ssid_likely` | Weaker SSID substring | **Likely** | 32 |
| `ie_fps` | 8-hex probe **IE fingerprint** (see below) | **"Class?"** | 32 |

### `macs`: for a randomised address that does not rotate

**Randomised is not the same as rotating**, and conflating the two cost a lot of
time. A locally administered MAC is invented by the device, so no manufacturer
stands behind it and no OUI table can ever match it. But it does not follow that
it changes: the first camera anyone checked twice kept the *identical* invented
address across visits days apart.

For that unit the address itself is the identifier, and `ouis` is the wrong tool
— three bytes of a random address is a prefix shared with whatever else happens
to randomise into it. `macs` compares all six.

Capped at `Class?` like every other user signature. You can also pin one from the
device without editing this file: open **Air Survey**, select the row, press
**Flag MAC**. That writes to `learned.txt` (12 hex digits, no colons) and needs
no restart of your editing workflow, only of the app.

If the camera *does* rotate its address, this will not help and a fingerprint is
what you want instead. Pin the address when you have seen the same one twice.

Matches are **additive** — your entries can only *add* detections, never remove or
weaken a built-in. Because user signatures are **unverified**, they are deliberately
capped: an OUI never scores above *Possible*, and an IE fingerprint never above the
candidate *"Class?"* rung — **never *Confirmed*, even alongside a Flock OUI**. This
is the precision-over-recall rule: a false "Flock" is worse than a missed one.

## Built-in SSID patterns

These ship compiled in; you don't need to add them. Listed so you can see what a
user pattern would be *adding to*.

| Pattern | Match rule | Scores |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `Flock-` + exactly 6 hex digits | anchored, whole SSID (`Flock-A1B2C3`) | **Confirmed** |
| `test_flck` | case-insensitive substring | **Confirmed** |
| `flock` | case-insensitive substring | **Likely** |
| `flck` | case-insensitive substring | **Likely** |

`test_flck` is the hard-coded development SSID reported as **CVE-2025-59409**, so its
presence on the air is close to self-identifying. The `Flock-` rule is *anchored* on
purpose: an unanchored substring wrongly confirmed benign names like `Flock-Guest` and
the Flock Freight corporate SSIDs, which now fall through to **Likely** instead.

## Seed signatures

[`signatures.seed.json`](signatures.seed.json) carries prefixes that are **tracked
upstream but not corroborated** — real candidates, not placeholders, and not proof.
Merge them into your own `signatures.json` if you want the extra recall; leave them
out if you'd rather not chase false positives.

| Prefix | Upstream status | Why it's still unverified |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `e0:0a:f6` | nitekry: *Active*, **no confidence note**. WatchFlock: **contract manufacturer** | Never independently corroborated, and its second source rates it *lower*, not higher |
| `14:b5:cd` | *"New finding testing"* (April 2026) | Still under test upstream |
| `04:0d:84` | Listed direct-Flock by WatchFlock | No stated corroboration |
| `f0:82:c0` | Listed direct-Flock by WatchFlock | No stated corroboration |
| `1c:34:f1` | Listed direct-Flock by WatchFlock | No stated corroboration |
| `38:5b:44` | Listed direct-Flock by WatchFlock | No stated corroboration |
| `94:34:69` | Listed direct-Flock by WatchFlock | No stated corroboration |
| `b4:e3:f9` | Listed direct-Flock by WatchFlock | No stated corroboration |
| `48:27:ea` | **Demoted from the built-ins in v0.73.** nitekry: *"low confidence, WiGLE crowdsource"* | IEEE registers it to **Samsung Electronics** |
| `a4:cf:12` | **Demoted from the built-ins in v0.73.** nitekry: *"low confidence, WiGLE crowdsource"* | IEEE registers it to **Espressif** |

  six below it) and `fy_flock_mfr_mac_prefixes[]` (`e0:0a:f6`). Neither array carries a
  per-prefix confidence or status column, which is precisely why these land here rather
  than in the built-ins.

**Why they aren't compiled in.** The built-in OUI table is a claim that a prefix was
*observed in a fielded Flock deployment*. Neither of these meets that bar, so putting
them there would overstate what's known. This file is the honest home for them. The
schema is a flat array of strings and the parser takes no per-entry metadata, so
there is nowhere in the JSON itself to mark an entry unverified — **this page is that
record.**

## What the built-in table is actually claiming

`flock_ouis[]` in `helpers/flock_db.c` describes itself as prefixes *observed in
fielded Flock Safety deployments*. That is true of most of it, but the 31 entries are
**not uniform evidence**, and nothing in the array says so. Recorded here so the claim
is not read as stronger than it is. **None of this changes scoring** — an OUI-only
match caps at *Possible* whatever its grade, and only ever contributes alongside probe
behaviour or an SSID/IE match.

| Grade | Prefixes | What is actually known |
|---|---|---|
| Flock's own registered OUI | `b4:1e:52` | IEEE-registered to Flock Safety (GainSec). The strongest entry in the table. |
| Field-corroborated | the remainder | Curated upstream table, `Active` or `High confidence`. `e4:aa:ea` caught a Falcon V2 in the field; `82:6b:f2` is DeFlockJoplin field testing. |
| Contract manufacturer | `f4:6a:dd`, `00:f4:8d`, `d0:39:57`, `e8:d0:fc` | Liteon/USI. WatchFlock files these **separately** from direct-Flock prefixes and warns a MAC match alone may be a false positive — these OUIs also ship unrelated consumer hardware. |
| Flat-list orphans | `70:08:94`, `58:00:e3`, `5c:93:a2`, `64:6e:69` | Inherited from the superseded flat list. Absent from the curated table in **every** section — not Active, not under test, not Removed. Kept because absence is not retraction, but their status is unverifiable upstream. |
| Weak upstream confidence | `08:3a:88` | Upstream notes it as *"BLE Ring conflict - unsure"*. Does **not** meet the field-corroboration bar. (`48:27:ea` and `a4:cf:12` were in this tier and were demoted to the seed file in v0.73 — see above.) |

Retracting any of these would only lose recall against evidence we do not have, so
they stay. But if you are weighing a single *Possible* OUI hit with nothing else
behind it, this table is what that hit is resting on.

## Axon Enterprise (`AX` rows)

> **Corrected 2026-08-29.** This section used to say an Axon hit could never be a
> pole-mounted camera, because Axon made only body-worn and in-car equipment. That
> is no longer true. In 2026 Axon launched **Outpost** and **Lightpost**, two

Axon makes body-worn and in-car police equipment (Axon Body, Axon Fleet) **and**
fixed infrastructure ALPR (Outpost, Lightpost). One OUI covers all of it, so an
`AX` row names the *vendor* and says nothing reliable about the form factor.

**Axon Lightpost is worth knowing about separately**, because it is not Axon
hardware underneath: it is built with **Ubicquia** and plugs into the NEMA
photocell socket of an existing streetlight. That means the OUI you would actually
see on the air is Ubicquia's, not Axon's — see [Vendor-exclusive
tables](#vendor-exclusive-tables-competitor-hardware) below.

Two identifiers, both taken straight from the issuing registry rather than from a
list:

| Identifier | Value | Registry |
|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi / BLE MAC OUI | `00:25:df` | IEEE — *Axon Enterprise, Inc.* |
| BLE company id | `0x034D` | Bluetooth SIG — *TASER International, Inc.* |

Both re-verified against their registries on 2026-08-29 and both still correct.

`0x034D` is filed under Axon's former name; they renamed from TASER International in
2017 and the SIG record kept the original. That is the same pattern as Flock's
`0x09C8`, which is filed under the battery vendor XUNTONG.

**Field status: registry-verified, never field-observed.** Nobody has captured an
Axon device using these on the air, and embedded products very often expose the
Wi-Fi *module* vendor's OUI instead of the brand owner's — which is exactly why most
Flock hardware shows up as Liteon or Espressif rather than `b4:1e:52`. So this may
match every Axon radio or none of them. Treat an `AX` row as a lead.

There is also a recall limit worth knowing. Axon body cameras are Wi-Fi **clients**,
not access points, and Axon's own documentation says a camera checks for an approved
network **every 15 minutes**. That check is a probe request and is what makes the
device detectable at all — but at that duty cycle you have to be listening in the
right window. Flock cameras probe roughly every 125 ms; this is four orders of
magnitude quieter.

### Two ways to get this badly wrong

**Do not add prefixes by searching a vendor database for "axon".** That substring
also matches *Axon Networks Inc* (`00:58:28`, `00:c0:d4`, `84:70:03`) — an unrelated
networking company — plus Axona, Axonne, Interaxon, Maxon, Praxon, Paxonet and
Yaxon. Twelve registrants, none of them police equipment. Axon Enterprise holds
**exactly one** OUI.

**Do not trust a curated "law enforcement OUI" list.** One in circulation was checked
entry by entry against the IEEE registry and **11 of its 15 prefixes were wrong**:

| It claimed | Actually registered to |
|---|---|
| Axon / TASER `00:1f:55` | Honeywell Security |
| Axon / TASER `00:0f:13` | Nisca |
| Digital Ally `00:11:24`, `00:1b:63` | Apple |
| WatchGuard / Motorola `00:1a:e9` | Nintendo |
| Panasonic i-PRO `e0:13:33` | General Motors |
| Panasonic i-PRO `3c:bb:fd` | Samsung |
| Getac `50:ec:50` | Xiaomi |
| Getac `00:1c:23` | Dell |
| Flock Safety `00:40:8c`, `ac:cc:8e` | Axis Communications |

Importing it would have reported Apple devices, Nintendo consoles, GM vehicles,
Xiaomi phones, Dell laptops and Samsung TVs as police surveillance equipment. Every
prefix in the table above is asserted as absent by `test/test_flock_db.c`, so
re-importing that list breaks the build. Verify at the registry, every time.

Either way the scoring is the same: an OUI hit from a user file caps at **Possible**,
exactly as a built-in OUI hit does. Nothing here can manufacture a *Confirmed*.

**Removed from the built-ins:** `f8:a2:d6`. Upstream marks it **Removed** — "low
confidence; hit on a Sony Media Player." Don't add it back through a user file
either. Same for `6c:cd:d6` (Netgear), `94:2a:6f` and `f4:e2:c6` (Ubiquiti),
`cc:cc:cc` (no hits), and `00:0c:e7` (possible false positive) — all retracted
upstream, and the last five never shipped here.

`f8:a2:d6` has been removed **twice**, and this page previously said it was gone
since v0.44 while five shipped releases still carried it. It was dropped for v0.44,
then silently re-added by a commit that reflowed the table (`93beede`, 2026-08-05),
and it shipped in **v0.67 through v0.71** — scoring *Likely* on any device sending an
ordinary wildcard probe request. Removed again in **v0.72**. Both the CI parity gate
and the host tests now assert every retracted prefix is absent, because the previous
guard only compared the two built-in tables to each other and that commit changed
both the same way. **If you are running v0.67–v0.71, this prefix is live in your
build.**

**Not imported, on purpose.** `JakeSwiz/WatchFlock` still lists both `cc:cc:cc` and
`f8:a2:d6` as direct-Flock prefixes. Its list is flat and statusless, so it has no way
to record that a prefix was later doubted — importing it wholesale would silently undo
the retractions above. Only the six prefixes named in the seed table were taken from
it, and only into this unverified file. **Do not bulk-import that list.**

## Vendor-exclusive tables (competitor hardware)

Cities that drop Flock are not dropping ALPR — they are switching vendors. So as of
v0.77 the app ships five more built-in OUI tables, one per competitor, and reports a
**vendor** alongside the class.

**Why this is a different kind of evidence from the Flock table.** `flock_ouis[]` is
29 prefixes of which 21 are LITEON; only `b4:1e:52` belongs to Flock Safety. It is a
list of *chip vendors Flock buys from*, so a bare match there describes millions of
ordinary consumer devices — which is why bare-OUI scoring was removed after it
reported a T-Mobile gateway. Every prefix below is registered to the **surveillance
vendor itself**, so "this beacon came from a Ubicquia device" is a real statement
where "this device contains a Liteon radio" is not.

| Vendor | Prefixes | IEEE organisation | Why it should emit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ubicquia | `94:7b:be` | *Ubicquia LLC* | UbiHub is a tri-band **Wi-Fi 6 access point**; the AP/AI variant adds dual 4K cameras and LPR. Base hardware for **Axon Lightpost**. |
| Motorola Solutions | `00:04:7d`, `00:18:85`, `00:1f:92`, `4c:cc:34`, `10:74:6f`, `b8:e2:8c`, `9c:86:2b` | *Motorola Solutions Inc.* ×4, *MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS MALAYSIA SDN. BHD.* ×3 | The **L6Q** plate reader has built-in LTE, Wi-Fi *and* Bluetooth, commissioned from a phone via their "LPR Mobile Companion" app. |
| Verkada | `e0:a7:00` | *Verkada Inc* | Cameras join Wi-Fi as **clients** (so they probe); the GW31E gateway is paired over Bluetooth. |
| Genetec | `00:bf:15`, `0c:bf:15` | *Genetec Inc.* | AutoVu. **Weakest table here** — published SharpV/SharpZ3 specs list wired Ethernet only. |
| Avigilon | `70:1a:d5` | *Avigilon Alta* | Motorola-owned; one of the brands Motorola sells fixed ALPR under. |

Also recorded but **not yet consumed**: `0x04EC`, Motorola Solutions' Bluetooth SIG
company id (verified — *not* `0x0008`, which is the legacy consumer-handset
registration). Wiring it up needs a new BLE category in the companion sketch, not
just a constant.

### How these score, and why they are capped

A vendor-exclusive hit scores **Possible**, on any frame type including a plain
beacon, and is never promoted beyond that.

- **Any frame type**, unlike the Flock table. A Flock camera is a station that does
  not beacon, so a Flock OUI on a beacon is by construction not a camera. A Ubicquia
  UbiHub *is* an access point — beaconing is its normal behaviour — so demanding
  probe-request behaviour would reject the very frames the table exists to catch.
- **Never above Possible**, because every one of these is registry-verified and
  **none has been captured on the air**. Embedded products routinely expose the
  Wi-Fi *module* vendor's OUI rather than the brand owner's — the reason most Flock
  gear appears as Liteon — so these may match every unit of a product line, or none.

### Vendor known, kind **not** known

These all report the class `Gear`, not `ALPR`, and that is deliberate. One Motorola
Solutions OUI covers plate readers, body cameras **and** APX/MOTOTRBO hand-held
radios; a UbiHub AP6 is public Wi-Fi with no camera at all while an AP/AI carries the
plate reader. Same prefix, nothing on the air to separate them. Naming the vendor is
honest; naming the product would not be.

### Vendors with no OUI at all

So nobody researches this twice: **Rekor, Vigilant, PlateSmart, Altumint, LiveView,
RedSpeed, Verra Mobility, Getac, Digital Ally and Panasonic i-PRO hold no IEEE
registration.** They buy their hardware. Any list claiming an OUI for them is
fabricating it. (SoundThinking does hold one, filed under its old name ShotSpotter —
already in the acoustic table.)

### Two look-alike traps, both live

The same substring trap documented for "axon" applies to two of the vendors above,
and here it is not hypothetical:

- **`motorola`** also matches *Motorola Mobility LLC, a Lenovo Company*
  (`50:16:f4`, `c4:a0:52`, `c8:58:95`, …) — consumer **phones**, a different company
  from Motorola Solutions. Adding one would repeat the `48:27:ea` / `a4:cf:12`
  failure on a far larger population.
- **`genetec`** also matches *GENETEC Corporation* (`00:0a:b1`), an unrelated
  Japanese company, and *Netgenetech* (`d8:c0:68`).

`tools/check_oui_parity.py` now blocks all of these by prefix, and
`test_flock_db.c` asserts each resolves to no vendor. Verify at the registry by
**organisation name** before adding anything.

## Unmanned aircraft (Remote ID)

Drones are found by **ASTM F3411 Remote ID**, not by a MAC table, and the reason
is worth stating plainly because it decides the whole design.

Every US police-drone vendor was resolved against the IEEE registry on
2026-09-07. Of the five a department realistically buys from today:

| Vendor | IEEE block |
|---|---|
| Skydio | `38:1d:14` |
| BRINC | **none** |
| Aerodome | **none** |
| Flock | `b4:1e:52` (the company block, not a drone block) |
| Paladin | **none** |

Three of the five hold nothing at all, so their radios transmit under whatever
module vendor they bought -- the same shared-prefix problem that already forced
Flock's Liteon prefixes down to "possible". **A prefix table cannot see the
modern police fleet, and never will.**

Remote ID can. It is a legal broadcast mandate (FAA 14 CFR Part 89), sent in the
clear with no association or pairing, and vendor-independent by construction: the
aircraft announces its own serial or registration, its own position, and -- in the
System message -- **the operator's position**.

FlipDeFlock decodes it over both transports the companion can hear:

- **BLE**, service data under 16-bit UUID `0xFFFA` with application code `0x0D`.
- **Wi-Fi beacons and probe responses**, vendor-specific IE with OUI `FA:0B:BC`
  and vendor type `0x0D`. DJI in particular favours this form, so a BLE-only
  receiver misses whole fleets while appearing to work.

A Remote ID detection is scored **Confirmed**, and it is worth being precise
about what that confirms: *a Remote ID broadcast was received*, so something is
flying and announcing itself. It is **not** a claim that the aircraft is a police
drone -- no signature could establish that, and the class says only "unmanned
aircraft".

Decoding happens on the Flipper (`helpers/open_drone_id.c`), never on the
companion, which only recognises the transport and forwards raw bytes. That is
deliberate: this is attacker-reachable radio input whose output is plotted on a
map, and the Flipper side is the side with host tests.

### Drone manufacturer OUIs (fallback only)

24 prefixes, **MA-L holders only**: SZ DJI Technology, DJI Baiwang, Skydio,
Parrot, Teal Drones, AeroVironment, Shield AI, Freefly, Zipline. A hit is scored
like any other bare OUI (possible) and is **not** evidence of a police drone --
DJI's blocks sit on far more hobbyist quadcopters than anything else.

**Rejected**, and enforced by `tools/check_oui_parity.py`:

- `f8:40:68` (DJI Ronin) and `20:1f:55` (DJI Osmo) -- genuinely DJI, but gimbals
  and handheld cameras. Neither flies.
- `4c:48:da`, `00:1f:64` -- "Beijing Autelan Technology", a networking company,
  not Autel Robotics. The same substring-of-a-vendor-name trap as Axon Networks.
- `ec:5b:cd`, `e0:b6:f5`, `34:b5:f3`, `ac:86:d1`, `24:a1:0d`, `b4:4d:43`,
  `e8:b4:70`, `18:d7:93` -- Autel Robotics, Yuneec, Inspired Flight, Quantum
  Systems, Cyon, UAV Navigation and Anduril all appear in community drone lists,
  and every one of them holds only a /28 inside a shared IEEE Registration
  Authority block. This table is three bytes wide, so matching them would flag
  arbitrary unrelated hardware as an aircraft.

## Body-worn cameras

- **Axon** -- OUI `00:25:df` (their only IEEE block), plus the **`BWCDEVICE`**
  ASCII tag in BLE service data. The tag is the stronger of the two: it is
  MAC-independent, so it survives address randomisation, and it identifies a
  body-worn camera *specifically*, where the OUI can only ever say "something Axon
  made" -- and Axon now ships fixed ALPR poles on that same block.
- **Utility, Inc ("BodyWorn")** -- OUIs `00:09:bc`, `00:16:ed`, plus adverts whose
  name contains `BodyWorn Remote`.
- **Digital Ally ("FirstVU")** -- OUI `00:23:bd`.

**Rejected**: `fc:01:9e` (VIEVU -- a real body-camera block, but Axon bought the
company in 2018 and discontinued the line) and `d4:2d:c5` (i-PRO -- a genuine
surveillance vendor whose range runs from body cameras to fixed network cameras
to industrial sensors, so the vendor is knowable and the product is not).

## Coverage outside the United States

Worth stating plainly, because the gap is structural rather than something a
signature file can fill.

**New Zealand is the clearest example.** Police reach there runs through **Auror**
and **SaferCities vGRID/VIBE** — vGRID alone hosts thousands of cameras across
hundreds of sites. But those are **software platforms that ingest existing retail and
council CCTV**. There is no Auror device and no vGRID device. The hardware is
ordinary Hikvision, Dahua, Uniview, Vivotek and Axis.

So FlipDeFlock deliberately does **not** ship those OUIs. Adding them would flag
every doorbell camera, every shop camera and quite possibly the user's own house as
surveillance infrastructure — a false-positive rate that would make the whole app
untrustworthy, to detect a network whose distinguishing feature is that it runs on
cameras that were already there. Precision over recall applies to whole vendors, not
just to individual prefixes.

What *does* generalise: Jenoptik (`00:04:4c`, `48:e3:c3`) ships speed and ANPR
enforcement hardware in AU/NZ/Europe, and Tattile, Nedap, Neology, Adaptive
Recognition and Iteris all hold real registrations. None is in a built-in table —
there is no evidence any of them emits Wi-Fi or BLE, and an unfireable table is worse
than an absent one because it reads like coverage. They are listed here so a field
capture that *does* hit one can be attributed.

## Capturing an IE fingerprint (`ie_fps`)

Fielded Flock cameras increasingly phone home as ordinary Wi-Fi **probe requests**
and rotate their MAC to dodge OUI matching. The probe's **IE fingerprint** — the
shape of its 802.11 information elements — is MAC-independent, so it still catches a
unit that has randomized its address.

To seed one from a unit you have **already confirmed** is Flock:

1. Open **Flock / ALPR Detect** and select the confirmed detection to open its
   detail screen.
2. Read the **`IE-fp:`** line (an 8-hex value, e.g. `IE-fp: 1a2b3c4d`). It only
   appears for probe-sourced detections that carried a fingerprint.
3. Add that value to the `ie_fps` array in `signatures.json`.

From then on, a probe with the same IE fingerprint — even from a *different,
randomized* MAC — is flagged **"Class?"** (a candidate device-class match). Only add
a fingerprint you've corroborated against a real deployment; it's a device-*class*
signature, not a unique device ID.

### Some real cameras can never be caught by a fingerprint

A fingerprint hashes the *shape* of a probe request, and nothing more. Two
consequences, and the second one is a permanent limit rather than a bug:

1. Any device running the same WiFi driver with the same scan configuration
   produces a byte-identical hash. Several such patterns are refused outright —
   see `flock_ie_fps_generic[]` in `helpers/flock_db.c` — because matching one
   would flag a large share of the phones on any street.
2. **Some genuine Flock hardware emits one of those commodity patterns.** This
   is field-confirmed, not theoretical: a unit on `24:B2:B9`, which is in the
   built-in Flock OUI table, was captured emitting `7c923b53` — the same skeleton
   that had already smeared across unrelated vendors in a separate report.

For those units the OUI is the only handle, and that is fine because they *have*
a usable OUI. The gap that actually matters is a camera that is **both** on an
unlisted or randomised address **and** emitting a commodity pattern. Nothing in
this file can catch that one; pin its address with `macs` if it is stable, and
otherwise it is Air Survey and your own eyes.

Precision over recall makes this trade deliberately. A hash shared with every
phone could not have identified the camera anyway.

### A hash you added can be retracted out from under you, and that is on purpose

The denylist is consulted **before every tier, including your own
`signatures.json`**. If a hash you added later turns out to be a commodity
pattern, a version bump makes it inert without you editing anything.

This is not hypothetical, and the first case was this project's own bad advice.
In September 2026 a maintainer told a reporter that `89c3debf` was "the device I
think is the camera … matches nothing else", and he added it. His next drive
found that hash on **ten devices spread over 7.9 km, at -17 to -96 dBm** — ten of
the nineteen rows in the hit table he sent back were phones. A fixed camera is
not in ten places at once. It is on the denylist now, so that card stopped
flagging phones the moment he updated.

Two things follow if you are curating your own file:

- **A strong, close, chatty device next to a camera you can see is not proof.**
  It is the *shape across a whole drive* that separates a camera from a phone.
  Check whether the hash turns up far away and weak as well.
- **Geography is the discriminator you have and the app does not.** The hash that
  survived that same drive, `ba9fafa0`, did so because its four devices were
  1.1 km to 6.1 km apart — they could not be one device rotating its address, and
  could not be something riding in the car. It ships as a candidate now.
