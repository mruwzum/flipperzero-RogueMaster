/*
 * ping.csv rows, and the bookkeeping behind them.
 *
 * A ping is not a protocol feature: it is a text message to a contact, and the
 * round trip is the time until the node pushes SEND_CONFIRMED carrying the ack
 * tag that SENT promised. meshlog.py measures it the same way, which is why
 * the numbers from a phone and from a Flipper can sit in one table.
 *
 * The state here is deliberately single-slot. One outstanding ping at a time
 * keeps the measurement honest: two in flight share the air, and each would be
 * timing the other's transmission as well as its own.
 *
 * Pure bookkeeping, no furi and no I/O — testable on a laptop.
