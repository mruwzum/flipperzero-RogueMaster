/*
 * Radio presets — a named set of settings you can push onto a node.
 *
 * The point is cloning: set one node up the way a network needs, save the
 * preset, then apply it to every other node without retyping five fields on a
 * 128x64 screen.
 *
 * Values are held in **wire units**, not display units: frequency in kHz and
 * bandwidth in Hz, because that is what SET_RADIO_PARAMS carries and the two
 * genuinely differ. Converting once at load time means the apply path never
 * has to think about it.
 *
 * Every field here is settable at runtime — including path_hash_bytes, which
 * was expected to be fixed at flash time and is not. See "Settings layers" in
 * AGENTS.md for the trace.
 *
 * Free of furi so the host tests can cover parsing and validation, which is
 * where a hand-edited file on an SD card will go wrong.
