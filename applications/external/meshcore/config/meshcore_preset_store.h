/*
 * The presets available to pick from: the compiled-in ones, plus whatever is

 *
 * Built-ins come first and always exist, so the Profiles screen is never empty
 * and a node can be set up with no SD card at all. Card presets follow, in
 * directory order.
 *
 * A file that does not parse is not silently skipped — it is kept with the
 * reason, and shown as a failed entry. A preset that quietly vanishes is worse
 * than one that says why it did not load, because the first thing anyone does
 * with a hand-edited JSON file is mistype a field name.
