/*
 * UART layer: a thin wrapper over furi_hal_serial.
 *
 * Knows nothing about MeshCore — it moves bytes. Both of the Flipper's
 * hardware ports are usable and interchangeable as far as this layer cares:
 *
 *   FuriHalSerialIdUsart   pin 13 = TX, pin 14 = RX
 *   FuriHalSerialIdLpuart  pin 15 = TX, pin 16 = RX
 *
 * GND is pin 18 (or 8 / 11). 115200 8N1 on either.
 *
 * RX arrives in interrupt context and is parked in a stream buffer, so
 * meshcore_uart_rx() blocks the *calling* thread, never the GUI thread.
 * Call it from a worker thread only.
