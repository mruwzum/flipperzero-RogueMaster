/*
 * scene_compose — write a message and send it to the current chat peer.
 *
 * Sending is not a protocol primitive: it is SEND_TXT_MSG, and the node's
 * MSG_SENT reply is the acknowledgement that it took the message for delivery.
 * That is the same handshake the logger's ping rides on, so the mechanics are
 * already proven on hardware; this scene wraps a keyboard around it.
 *
 * The send blocks on the link, so it runs on a worker thread. TextInput is the
 * keyboard; the widget shows "Sending..." and any error. On success the
 * outgoing line is recorded in the message store and the scene returns to the
 * chat, which rebuilds and shows it — no extra plumbing, because chat already
 * redraws when messages.total changes.
