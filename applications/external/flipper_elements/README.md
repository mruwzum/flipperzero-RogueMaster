# Flipper Elements

**A compact periodic table of the elements for Flipper Zero.**

Explore essential chemical and physical data for all 119 elements directly on your Flipper Zero.  
Designed for quick reference, study, laboratory notes, educational use, and science-focused hardware projects.

**Author:** [Siarhei Besarab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siarhei_Besarab) (aka steanlab)

## Features

* **Complete Element Database:** Contains data for all 119 elements, stored entirely in flash memory (.rodata) with no runtime RAM overhead.

* **Element Identification:** Displays the element name, symbol, atomic number [Z], category, atomic weight, and CAS Registry Number.

* **IUPAC-Compatible Atomic Masses:** For elements without a standard atomic weight, the mass number of the longest-lived isotope is shown in square brackets, for example [98] for technetium and [209] for polonium. Th, Pa, and U retain conventional atomic-weight values due to their characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition. 

* **Chemical Data:** Shows common oxidation states, electronic/quantum configuration, and the total number of known or experimentally observed isotopes.

* **Atomic-Scale Data:** Includes atomic radii, covalent radii, and dominant ionic radii. Radius values are displayed in picometers (pm), together with the relevant ion formula where applicable.

* **Physical Data:** Displays density, melting point, boiling point, approximate Mohs hardness, magnetic behaviour near room temperature, crystal structure, and abundance in the Earth’s crust (ppm).

* **Magnetic Properties:** Includes bulk magnetic classifications such as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic where applicable.

* **Crystal Structures:** Shows elemental crystal structures at approximately ambient pressure. Common abbreviations are expanded for readability, for example *fcc* -> *face-centred cubic*, *bcc* -> *body-centred cubic*, and *hcc* -> *hexagonal close-packed*.

* **Smart Mini-Map:** Navigate precisely through groups, periods, and the overall layout of the periodic table.

* **Navigation UI:** Supports intuitive linear traversal through the elements by atomic number, while preserving spatial navigation across the periodic-table layout.

* **Optimized for Flipper Zero:** The complete element dataset is compiled into flash memory (.rodata), avoiding dynamic allocation and runtime RAM overhead.

## Control Layout

* **Up** / **Down** — Move vertically through the periodic-table layout. Navigation dynamically bypasses structural gaps.
* **Left** / **Right** — Browse elements sequentially by atomic number [Z].
* **Short Press OK** — Open the detailed element property card.
* **Long Press OK** — Open the application information screen with author, version, and credits.

## Data Fields

The detailed element card may include:

* Atomic number [Z], name, symbol, category, atomic weight, and CAS Registry Number
* Common oxidation states
