## Hardware

- Flipper Zero
- Official Wi-Fi Developer Board based on ESP32-S2
- microSD card in the Flipper Zero

## ESP-AT configuration

The official board UART connected to Flipper uses:

- ESP32-S2 UART TX: GPIO17
- ESP32-S2 UART RX: GPIO18
- Baud rate: 115200
- Hardware flow control: disabled

The application opens `FuriHalSerialIdLpuart`. The factory parameter source used for the
ESP-AT NVS partition is available in `firmware/mfg_nvs_flipper.csv`.

The ESP-AT firmware itself is not redistributed by this repository. Download a compatible
ESP32-S2 ESP-AT release from Espressif and replace its `mfg_nvs` partition with one generated
from the included CSV.

## Build

Install [uFBT](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt), then run:

```sh
ufbt
```

The resulting application is:

```text
dist/wifi_internet_watch.fap
```

Copy it to:

```text
/ext/apps/GPIO/wifi_internet_watch.fap
```

## Usage

1. Install the ESP-AT firmware configured for GPIO17/GPIO18.
2. Mount the Wi-Fi Developer Board on Flipper Zero.
3. Open **Apps → GPIO → WiFi Internet Watch**.
4. Select a network, enter its password, and wait for the status screen.

Saved networks are marked with `*`. Press **OK** to connect using the saved password,
hold **OK** to edit it, or press **Right** (`Forget`) to delete it. New and updated
passwords are saved only after ESP-AT successfully joins the network.

Press **Left** in the network list to open settings, where you can edit the internet
check IP address or timer.

From the settings menu you can also change the internet check timer in seconds or reset
the app back to defaults. Reset clears the saved IP, restores the 60-second timer, and
removes all remembered Wi-Fi networks.

On the monitoring screen, **Back** returns to Wi-Fi scanning instead of closing the app.

The password screen supports lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, spaces, and common
symbols. Select the `Aa`, `#?`, or `ab` key to switch between lowercase, uppercase, and
symbol layouts. Select `OK` on the keyboard to connect, and use **Back** to delete.

Credentials are stored in the application's private data file on the microSD card. They
are not encrypted, so anyone with access to the card can recover them.
