"""Draw the eMRTD mark, everywhere it is needed, from one definition.

The mark is the contact plate of the chip module inside a travel document:
a plate divided into six pads. It is defined once, on a ten by ten grid,
because that is the hardest place it has to work - the Flipper launcher shows
the application icon at exactly that size, in one bit colour, with no
antialiasing to hide behind. Everything larger is the same grid scaled by a
whole number, so an edge is never half a pixel anywhere.

Run with:

    uv run --with pillow python assets/make_logo.py

Outputs:
    images/emrtd_10px.png      the application icon, 10x10, one bit
    images/EmrtdChip_24x24.png the same mark for the reading screen
    assets/logo.svg            the mark and the wordmark, as vector art
    assets/logo.png            a raster export of the same
    assets/logo.txt            the mark as text, for a terminal or a README
