"""Draw the QR code the Donate screen shows.

The code carries exactly the address the README's Support section links to,
and nothing else. The Flipper has no QR encoder in its SDK, and the address
never changes, so the code is encoded once, here, and compiled into the
application as an icon rather than built at run time.

Run with:

    uv run --with segno --with pillow --with zxing-cpp python assets/make_donate_qr.py

Output:
    images/EmrtdDonateQr_58x58.png   the code, two pixels per module, one bit
