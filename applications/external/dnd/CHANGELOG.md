## 4.20.2 — 2026-10-06 UTC

- Attach Spellbook loading UI before collection validation. Preserve paged record access and offset indexes; use bounded external merge sorting for imports and verified single-record reinsertion for ordinary ordering edits. Validate current contents instead of trusting a persistent sorted flag.
- Journal two-bag inventory transfers with checksummed staged contents and deterministic recovery. Recover before shared collection access, block editing when recovery fails, and discard stale UI selections before retry. Journal-created inventory items also honor this guard.
- Compile the transaction helper into all shared-storage users and the Journal FAL, and the sorting helper into Spellbook. FAL IDs and API versions remain unchanged.
- See RELEASE_AUDIT_STATUS.md for new reproducible host checks and outstanding ARM/device acceptance. Earlier entries below are historical and are not re-certified by this delta.

## 4.20.1 — 2026-10-06 UTC

- Randomized startup, local loading and app-handoff artwork across fifteen choices: the existing splash plus all fourteen supplied images, including Monk, Sorcerer, Warlock and Barbarian. The existing animated hourglass remains over the selected image.
- Replaced linked splash icons with raw 1,024-byte file assets. Hub and loading FAL each bundle all choices as nonresident `.fapassets` data; native preload streams them to SD. First extraction/update writes the whole bundle, but normal image acquisition reads only its selected file.
- Added one shared, reference-counted bitmap across overlapping Hub and separately mapped loading FAL instances. Last-owner cleanup runs after callback/view teardown; the data survives the module that allocated it. Missing/corrupt image data retries the other SD copy and then the original in the same buffer, with text/hourglass fallback if no image can load.
- Loading API version 2 lives at `/ext/apps_data/dndolphins/plugins/dnd_loading.fal`. Public direct drawing keeps splash/hourglass alive through outgoing teardown while the incoming app attaches its views. Readiness matches a copied destination FAP path, avoiding dependence on reusable thread IDs.
- Cleanup runs from a DND app thread after unsubscribing and draining timer callbacks. Native load failure/cancellation/incoming exit and a ten-second guard restore drawing; one inactive cache is retained until the next DND readiness/handoff can safely unmap it.
- Added Loader barriers before DND module map/free operations. Retained the four feature FALs, splash timer-lifetime fix, Hold OK Bag Mover and immediate per-item Container moves.
- Corrected startup splash and loading FAL cleanup: keep the animation callback, context and borrowed view alive until native animation free deletes and drains the timer queue. Stop alone does not acknowledge queued callbacks in the supplied firmware implementation.
- Added a late-callback shutdown regression for repeated splash and real loading FAL lifetimes. It rejects both 4.20.0 cleanup paths and passes the correction. Twenty-one host regressions pass; native ARM and device acceptance remain outstanding.
- Converted Character Sheet, Journal, focused Monster Turn Tools and Combat's spell damage resolver into four versioned FALs. Sheet/Journal retain thin standalone wrappers and now open in the Hub. Initiative retains its encounter while using focused tools; Bestiary shares the tools FAL. Combat validates damage code before spending casting resources.
- Added a fifth loading FAL using the existing DND splash with animated SDK hourglass. Included a firmware loader/GUI patch to retain it across FAP teardown/startup, use explicit thread readiness, exclude in-flight GUI callbacks before unloading, serialize concurrent SDK loaded-module list mutations, and clean up on cancellation/failure/timeout. Firmware rebuild/flash and FAL deployment are required for between-FAP coverage.
- Hub startup activates Home before removing its splash. All eleven FAPs enqueue while their GUI remains attached. Local UI FAL transitions borrow the same loading artwork.
- Bag Mover Hold OK opens destination selection for checked Items from any row, with a visible hint and retained Move Selected row. Per-item Container selection moves directly between Main, Group and named bags and continues editing without another screen; Repeat input cannot trigger extra moves.
- Journal return discards stale collection caches and reloads the exact canonical character. Failed refresh prevents stale/default saves. Bestiary Tools is reachable on both normal/custom detail menus; bulk/per-item movement discards committed stale caches before reload.

## 4.20.0
- **2026-10-04 compile/integration correction:** removed duplicate editor-release forward declarations; corrected missing lazy-runtime checks in common input, profile, Language/Proficiency and Settings paths; reacquired cache descriptors after final-page release; preserved Catalog selection before descriptor teardown.
- **Companion correctness:** Favorite Spells now builds/owns its bounded index and page on entry; Combat retains session Roll mode through Magic statistics; selected Hub Feats save before dependent review hands off to DNDGrants.
- **Current-source validation:** retired the inactive `.inc` and three source wrappers, updated test/audit/layout consumers and mode-specific object caching, added actual-input/lifetime/allocation-failure regressions, and passed eleven strict manifest builds/lifecycles plus fourteen ASan/UBSan regression executables. Regenerated current memory/executable/stack proxies and documented outstanding ARM/device gates.
- **Runtime memory/lifetime optimization:** replaced the monolithic shared-source include pattern with a normal `dnd_app_core.c` plus explicit Hub/Combat/Grants entry headers/translation units; reduced the 32-bit common app-state proxy from 4,676 B to **3,416 B** (1,260 B / 26.9%) by making profile browsing, catalog state, roll/dice state, grant-review state, collection cache/index state, page-offset tables and text-edit storage transient and moving Combat working state into a 248 B Combat-only runtime. Autosave/input hooks/editors are first-use/last-use resources; teardown now releases the catalog descriptor itself, streamed collection/cache descriptors are released as soon as their last page/index consumer exits, Catalog Back preserves return state before releasing that descriptor, and Bestiary no longer holds the global input-event subscription outside TextInput.
- **Build compatibility:** replaced bounded `%s` copy helpers that could trigger GCC `-Wformat-truncation` under `-Werror`, including the Bestiary text-edit completion path.
- **Roadmap cleanup:** removed unapproved and already-completed feature proposals so the roadmap contains no speculative feature list.
- **Reliability and save safety:** hardened Settings, Inventory bags, Features/Perks, Journal-to-Inventory handoffs, progression sidecars, Adventure campaign installation/registry updates, and Backup/Restore copies so interrupted SD reads/writes preserve the last complete data and clean up only files created by the failed operation.
- **Backup & Restore:** strengthened external SHD copy/restore staging, read-error detection, rollback behavior, backup-folder settings, and retry safety. Backup & Restore remains its own FAP and DNDolphins only launches it.
- **Adventure and Journal:** campaign-pack installation is transactional and retry-safe; milestone Journal creation and Journal-created Inventory Items now roll back safely on storage failures.
- **Collection safety:** fixed malformed short-line parsing, Language/Proficiency page ownership when switching record types, and first-create handling for Inventory/Main, named bags, starting equipment, and Feature/Perk sidecars.
- **Bestiary and shared settings:** party settings and other small authoritative settings/registry files now publish transactionally instead of truncating live files in place.
- **Audit and regression coverage:** expanded failure-injection tests for interrupted reads/writes, malformed Settings, path collisions, restore rollback, campaign-pack retry, and large Spellbook/Inventory/Feature/Language/Proficiency collections. The host ASan/UBSan suite remains green across all 11 FAPs.
- **Documentation and packaging:** reconciled feature ownership and current memory/evidence reports, corrected the 11-FAP documentation, refreshed the feature-evidence audit, and established that source/audit/release ZIPs never contain a `dist/` directory. Compiled FAPs are external build outputs.


## 3.6.7
- **Full 3.6.7 bug audit:** fixed DNDBackup & Restore's seven-row menu rendering beyond the 128x64 screen by converting it to a five-row scrolling window.
- Tightened Backup Folder validation to accept only `/ext` or `/ext/...`; strings that merely begin with `/ext` are no longer accepted.
- Clone Active Character now rolls the clone back if the refreshed profile index cannot be saved, preventing hidden partially-published clones.
- The DNDBackup profile-ID row is informational rather than a selectable no-op; focus starts on the first actionable row.
- Fixed Bestiary → Initiative imports being appended to persistent **Party Roster**, which caused monsters to be tagged as party members in history and blocked Monster Turn Tools. Imported monsters now enter the current encounter/combat list.
- Bestiary transfers now open Initiative's current combat/setup directly, preventing **Start New Combat** from overwriting a just-imported monster group.


- **Debug-only Progression Diagnostics menu:** DNDGrants now shows **Progression Diagnostics** as a normal Grant Review option only when the shared DNDolphins **Debug** setting is enabled. The previous hidden hold-Right shortcut was removed.

- Added **Clone Active Character** to DNDBackup & Restore. It allocates the next local profile ID and reuses the existing transactional profile-duplication path, including Spellbook, Inventory/Main and named bags, Features, applied grants, Languages and Proficiencies. The clone does not replace or switch the active character automatically.
- Added **Validate Character** to DNDBackup & Restore. It reuses the canonical profile verifier/parser and adds semantic checks for class levels, ability-score bounds and HP sanity without modifying the character.
- Added **Progression Diagnostics** to DNDGrants. From Grant Review, hold Right to inspect Applied, Pending, Pending Choice and Skipped/manual-review states. Up/Down selects a staged grant and OK exposes its stable ID/payload summary. No new progression storage or duplicate grant state was introduced.
- Removed the rejected/stale 3.6.7 roadmap section so the roadmap remains future-only.

## 3.6.6

- Added **Campaign Reward Preview** to DNDAdventure. Choices carrying an Item reward, milestone, quest flag, or achievement now show the pending reward/state changes before the choice is committed. **Apply Choice** runs the existing Adventure choice/reward path; **Cancel** returns without changing progress or character data.
- Audited editable TXT catalogs, metadata/grant sources, and Adventure campaign packs for content hash locking. Production loaders do not compare these files against shipped SHA/checksum/digest values. Existing Bestiary and Spellbook name/ID hashes are runtime lookup/index helpers, not content-integrity locks, so editing the TXT data remains supported.
- Removed the unused 3.6.6 Rules/customization/extensibility roadmap section. TXT editing remains the intended content-customization path.

## 3.6.5
- Journal Body/Notes now opens a full-screen wrapped note editor instead of the single truncated detail row editor.
- The full-screen note editor exposes an insertion cursor: Left/Right moves by character, Up/Down moves by wrapped line, and OK opens the full-screen keyboard to insert text at that exact cursor position.
- Hold Left deletes the character before the cursor; Hold Right deletes the character at the cursor. Back returns to the Journal entry without changing the Journal schema.

- Added **New Session Log** to DNDJournal. It creates an Adventure-category entry dated from the Flipper RTC with structured editable note sections for Party State, Milestones, NPCs / Monsters, Loot / Rewards, and Notes, using the existing Journal entry format.
- Added **Search Journal**. Search requires at least **3 characters**, performs case-insensitive partial-string matching, and checks both the entry title and the complete editable Journal note/body.
- Journal search streams entries from the active character's existing journal directory and retains only a bounded 24-result window; it does not sort or load the whole journal into RAM.
- Added a DNDJournal landing menu so Entries, Search, Session Log creation, and Return to DNDolphins remain distinct workflows.
- Removed completed/rejected Adventure/Journal QoL ideas from the future roadmap. Campaign Reward Preview remains the only 3.6.5 roadmap item.

## 3.6.4

- Added **Monster Turn Tools** to DNDInitiative combat participant editing. Non-party participants can launch directly into the matching DNDBestiary stat block by name and return to the same active Initiative combat.
- DNDBestiary adds a **Monster Turn Tools** action on stat blocks. It parses up to four common `Attack Roll:` entries from the monster's existing Actions text, rolls the d20 attack with the listed bonus, and rolls up to two listed damage dice expressions from the matching Hit text.
- Added **Combat History** to DNDInitiative. It browses the completed encounter files already written by **End + Save History**, newest first, and shows date/time, round count, party state, and surviving opponents without creating a second history format.
- Removed the rejected 3.6.4 roadmap items: Encounter Round Notes, Encounter Group Inserts, Initiative Condition Duration, Encounter Loot Packages, Party Damage/Healing Actions, and Reinforcement Waves.

## 3.6.3

- **Architecture audit:** moved external SHD bundle operations out of shared `dnd_storage.c` into `dnd_backup_storage.*`, linked only by DNDBackup & Restore.
- Removed the now-unused legacy `dnd_storage_export_profile()` and `dnd_storage_import_first()` APIs.
- DNDBackup & Restore now uses the native Flipper file browser for `.shd` restore selection instead of requiring a typed restore path.
- Added the packaged **10×10 1-bit SHD browser icon** at `dndbackup_images/shd_sword_10x10.png`; it reuses the correctly sized sword-style FAP artwork and is passed to the native browser for `.shd` files.
- External SHD bundles are validated and transactionally staged with rollback protection before the shared internal SHD restore engine updates live data.
- Backup destinations now support recursive `/ext/...` directory creation.

- Added **Favorite** state to canonical Spell records. DNDSpellbook sets/unsets favorites; DNDCombat adds **Favorite Spells** and routes selections through the existing casting/resource workflow. Favorite state is persisted in the Spellbook sidecar and therefore travels with normal SHD spell snapshots.
- Added standalone **DNDBackup & Restore** FAP. It stores a user-selected backup folder, creates a coherent current-level SHD bundle there, validates an external core SHD before restore, imports its matching companion SHDs, and uses the existing transactional SHD restore/rollback engine.
- Removed DNDolphins profile actions for **Export**, **Import First Export**, **Restore Backup**, and **Restore from SHD**, along with the embedded SHD restore screen/handler. DNDolphins now only launches DNDBackup & Restore for the active character.
- Suite now contains **11 FAPs**.

## 3.6.2 WIP

- Added Inventory and Spellbook name search with case-insensitive partial-string matching.
- Search requires at least 3 characters; shorter entries are rejected and do not scan.
- Search preserves the existing Inventory and Spellbook ordering and uses bounded lightweight result indexes rather than sorting/loading full records.
- Spellbook catalog search combines with the existing level/class/ritual/school/source/status filters.

## 3.6.1

- Added integrated Quick Rolls for abilities, saving throws and skills using the existing d20 roller. Abilities & Saves now visibly selects Check or Save with Left/Right, and OK rolls the selected type.
- Consolidated Character grant access into one Grant Review entry that launches the DNDGrants FAP.
- Added selectable loose-ammunition stacks when multiple matching stacks are available.
- Removed redundant planned/experimental Quick Bar, Concentration Helper, Rest Preview, Reaction Turn Sync, and Character Summary Card features.


## 3.6 memory/ownership cleanup

- Added a **2-second DNDolphins launch splash** using the native 128×64 monochrome project logo. It is shown only when DNDolphins is launched with no arguments; return-focus/deep-link launches skip it. DNDolphins now also owns the Home-menu 25×25 icon assets used by Graphical Menu Type; companion FAPs do not link those private graphics.
- Full post-integration audit corrected DNDGrants parent return routing so Grants now relaunches DNDolphins with `focus=character` instead of a null argument; returning from Grants therefore bypasses the no-argument startup splash just like the other companion FAPs. Graphical-menu validation now checks the final supplied artwork rather than obsolete placeholder-byte equality.
- Added standalone **DNDCharacter Sheet** FAP, launched from **DNDolphins → Character → Character Sheet**. It renders ten native 128×64 graphical pages covering identity/class, all abilities, saves, all 18 skills, combat/health, passives, spellcasting, defenses, senses and movement; Short Back returns with Character focused and Hold Back exits to firmware.
- Added DNDBestiary **Custom Encounter**: starts empty, adds monsters from the catalog/detail workflow, provides Difficulty Simulator/composition review, Save Encounter and Add to Initiative.
- Bestiary now enforces shared **Homebrew** across all custom-pack selection paths, including Source: Any, Favorites/Recents, generated/custom encounters and saved-encounter resume/Initiative; the startup projection remains slim at Debug + Homebrew only.
- Added DNDInventory **bags** with a Bag field above + Add New. Main remains `inventory_<id>.txt`, Group is permanent at `invGroup_<id>.txt`, named bags use `inv<BagName>_<id>.txt`, Resources aggregate all bags, and profile duplicate/archive/export/import plus SHD v3 preserve Inventory by bag.
- Added final-list **Bag Mover** with current-bag multi-select and destination-bag selection. Hold OK on a normal Item still toggles Equipped. Bulk moves publish source/destination together and repair container indexes.
- Added **Combat Utility Spells** above Rituals; Spell Attacks now contains only available attack-roll spells, while the utility list contains available non-attack spells without imposing a total-spell cap.
- Combat spell rows now show the resolved casting ability and attack modifier after each spell name, e.g. `(WIS/+5)`.
- **Unarmed Strike**, **Grapple**, and **Shove** are now separate persisted Attack Templates. Grapple/Shove use independent editable save-DC templates instead of synthetic rows derived from Unarmed Strike; older profiles gain the missing templates without overwriting existing ones.
- Spellbook owned rows now show a right-aligned three-character source tag from the class or actual Origin/Feat/grant name (`WIZ`, `HIG`, `MAG`, etc.).
- DNDBestiary now loads only the shared Debug/Homebrew projection at startup, hides Pack Diagnostics unless Debug is On, and exposes custom-pack monsters through a **Homebrew** Source filter when Homebrew is enabled.
- Added **Hold OK: Apply Level Grants** to the post-level review while preserving the existing Short OK ASI/Feat flow.
- Moved DNDolphins Home **Magic & Spells** management into DNDSpellbook; direct Magic launch and a visible terminal **Magic & Spells** row at the end of the Spellbook open the new view, while Arcane Recovery execution remains in DNDCombat.
- Reduced Languages/Proficiencies to a lazy four-record owned-list page and eight-row catalog page with no total-record cap; the 300-record host regression remains passing.
- Reduced the 32-bit DNDolphins fixed app-state proxy from 4,892 B to **4,616 B** after removing the permanently embedded Language/Proficiency page buffer and reserving two additional persisted Attack Template slots for Grapple/Shove migration.

## 3.6 — Catalog compliance, grants, performance and documentation

- Strengthened SRD catalog/grant validation across Character, Spellbook, Inventory, proficiencies, starting equipment, abilities/features and trinkets.
- Expanded SRD grant coverage and cross-checked **475 fixed SRD grant payloads** against SRD-valid spell, feat, language, skill, save, proficiency, size, resistance, sense and speed values.
- Kept DNDInventory as the exclusive owner of starting-equipment writes and added explicit **Review inventory grant** confirmation; primary-class saving throws and starting languages use reviewed grants.
- Consolidated Character and Spellbook onto one canonical **355-spell SRD catalog**, retained the Any/Cantrip/Level 1–9 Spellbook filter, and added Known/knowable/free-granted totals.
- Restored the 36 Homebrew/DNDolphins Item rows to the normal Item catalog, renamed user-facing **Extra Items** to **Get Elevated**, and retained the legacy `ExtraItems=` key only for save compatibility. Get Elevated controls randomized bundle granting; Homebrew controls catalog visibility.
- Corrected generic **Unarmed Strike** math: attack = ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus, damage = `1 + ability modifier`, and Grapple/Shove DC = `8 + ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus` before applicable attack-only modifiers.
- Reduced avoidable storage/heap work: Settings reads in 128-byte chunks with best-effort per-line recovery, DNDolphins defers the complete `Catalog: All` availability check until Settings is opened, Spellbook status filtering uses a fixed **128-byte negative prefilter** before exact matches, and the release gate keeps direct heap/storage work out of the audited draw helpers (currently **76 direct static draw helpers**).
- Completed the active Pocket-era namespace migration across types, enums, helpers and constants; only isolated read-only legacy file-format aliases remain for compatibility. New saves/pack manifests use DND naming. DNDInitiative remains at a **4 KB stack reservation**; its ~5.28 KB app state is heap-owned, not stack-owned.
- Reworked the 3.6 memory audit around Loader residency and allocation lifetimes. The earlier shared-shell checkpoint measured **4,892 B** after the persisted Menu Type addition; the later memory/ownership cleanup above removes the resident Language/Proficiency page buffer and reduces the current hub proxy to **4,616 B**. Debug mode retains heap checkpoints for startup diagnostics.
- Shared and Bestiary party settings remain small reconstructable state, but the 3.6.8 audit now publishes them transactionally through `.tmp`/`.bak` companions so interrupted writes cannot truncate live settings.
- Split **DNDCombat** and **DNDGrants** into standalone FAPs so DNDolphins tears down before either high-cost workflow starts. Combat adds **Jump to Initiative** with source-aware return routing: Initiative returns to DNDCombat only when launched from Combat; other Initiative launches return to DNDolphins.
- Added persisted **Settings → Menu Type** with **Text** (default) and **Graphical**. Graphical Home renders a 4×2 native icon grid, supports Up/Down/Left/Right navigation, frames the selected icon and places the selected menu name in the header. All 15 Home entries use supplied native 25×25 monochrome artwork with stable per-entry filenames for future independent replacement.
- Combat attack browsing remains streamed and unbounded by the 25-action menu; host regressions exercise **300 spells and 300 weapons** and reach the final record.
- Updated README, feature checklist, catalog/grant audits, memory audit and roadmap to reflect completed behavior and remaining work.

## 4.19.0a–c — Scalable collections, shared settings and table usability

- Removed former small owned Spell/Item/Feature ceilings while retaining bounded eight-record pages and stable collection ownership.
- Added shared Settings, SHD bundles/restore with rollback support, and scalable catalog-backed Languages and Proficiencies sidecars.
- Improved Combat casting information, Inventory ordering/quantity/filter controls, starting-equipment coverage and Spellbook sorting.
- Preserved bounded storage behavior and compatibility with older snapshots.

## 4.19 — Spell filters

- Added **Character Classes** as the default Spellbook class filter plus **Any Class** and bundled class filters.
- `Allowed` applies character spell-list/level eligibility; `All Spells` browses the selected catalog class directly.

## 3.5.x — Grants, choices, Inventory and Adventure

- Added progression Feat **Allowed/All** filtering, Level Choices, explicit deterministic grant actions and stronger grant persistence/status handling.
- Added completed-encounter history, Stack Qty editing, safer container deletion/remapping and improved Inventory paging.
- Added loose ammunition matching and consumption, Adventure full-scene viewing/checkpoint controls and additional bundled project content.
- Added fixed-average level-up HP/Hit Dice refresh and Journal milestone leveling integration.

## 3.4.x — Profile projections and navigation

- Added bounded Level-Up Review, narrow streamed profile projections and expanded structured spell-combat mappings.
- Improved Initiative large-roster navigation and DNDolphins Home/Combat menu organization.

## 3.3.x — Split FAP ownership and bounded collections

- Consolidated active-profile handoff and companion return-focus behavior.
- Moved Inventory/Currency and Spellbook ownership into their standalone FAPs with bounded paging, editors and immediate persistence.
- Added one-time starting-inventory regrant, generic Spell Scroll rows, Rituals combat support and draw-path stability work.
- Moved app-specific helpers out of shared modules and tightened allocation cleanup.
