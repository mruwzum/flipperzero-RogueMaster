  <b>Specter</b> turns your Flipper Zero into a pocket <b>counter-surveillance bug-sweep</b> for
  <b>active 13.56 MHz NFC readers</b>. It <i>passively listens</i> for the RF field that a powered-on
  reader is constantly emitting — a hidden card skimmer slipped into a payment terminal, a covert
  reader behind a door panel, a rogue logger taped under a desk — then tells you <b>where it is</b>,
  <b>what kind of thing it is</b>, <b>whether the room is clean</b>, and — left on watch — <b>the
  moment one appears while you're away</b>. It never transmits.

## ✨ The five modes

Specter is five tools around one sensor. Each answers a different question, so
the right one depends on what you are actually trying to find out:

| Mode | The question it answers | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 **Sweep** | *Where is it?* | You suspect a device and want to pinpoint it by moving around |
| 🔬 **Fingerprint** | *What kind of thing is it?* | You have found an emitter and want to know how it behaves |
| 🗺️ **Site Survey** | *Is this room clean?* | You want one verdict for a whole space, hands-free |
| 🛰️ **Watch Mode** | *Did one appear while I was away?* | You are leaving the Flipper somewhere to stand guard |
| 📖 **Logbook** | *What did I find, and when?* | You are writing it up, or comparing today with last week |

---

### 🔍 Sweep — *where is it?*

<img src="images/screen_reader_max.png" width="42%" align="right" alt="Sweep — reader found, meter pegged">

**What it does.** A live EMF-style meter. Hold the Flipper flat and move it slowly
over the thing you're checking — a card terminal, a door reader, the underside of
an ATM lip, a parcel, a desk. The needle rides the field strength in real time.

**What you see.**
- **The dial** — needle = live reading, the small dot = *peak-hold* (the strongest
  spot you've touched, so you can compare positions).
- **`FIELD %`** — the same reading as a number, with a **▲ / ▼ trend arrow**
  telling you whether the last half-second made things *warmer or colder*. When
  you're hunting, that arrow matters more than the number.
- **`PK` / `C`** — peak reading and how many separate contacts you've had.
- **Bottom strip** — the live waveform and your current sensitivity while quiet;
  it flips to a black **`● ACTIVE READER`** alarm bar with a proximity word the
  moment a carrier is detected.
- **Proximity** — `FAINT → NEAR → CLOSE → STRONG → MAX`. `MAX` means the meter is
  *pegged*: you're as close as this measurement can resolve.

**Sound.** Optional geiger clicks that **speed up as you get closer**, so you can
sweep with the Flipper in your pocket and hunt by ear alone.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `OK` | Reset peak-hold and contact count |
| `hold OK` | Save this reading to the logbook |
| `LEFT` | Calibrate to the room's noise floor (3 s) |

<br clear="right">

### 🔬 Fingerprint — *what kind of thing is it?*

<img src="images/screen_fingerprint.png" width="42%" align="right" alt="Fingerprint — polling reader identified">

**What it does.** Once Sweep has found something, hold the Flipper **still**
against it. Fingerprint stops measuring proximity and starts **timing the
carrier's on/off edges**, which is what actually distinguishes one kind of
emitter from another.

**What you see.** A verdict, a confidence bar, and the evidence behind both:

| Class | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **CONTINUOUS** | The carrier is held permanently up |
| **POLLING** | A fixed, crystal-timed poll cycle — the period is shown in ms |
| **INTERMITTENT** | Bursty but irregular — often a phone or a reader in use |

Underneath are `PER` (poll period), `BST` (burst width), `JIT` (jitter) and
`DUTY` (true duty-cycle), plus a **logic-analyser pulse train** of the raw
carrier — so the verdict is never something you have to take on faith. A genuine
polling reader shows up as an unmistakable square wave.

> A `~` before a timing means it's close to the 2 ms sampling floor, and the
> confidence is discounted to match.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `OK` | Save the finding to the logbook |
| `hold OK` | Restart the measurement |

<br clear="right">

### 🗺️ Site Survey — *is this room clean?*

<img src="images/screen_survey_done.png" width="42%" align="right" alt="Site Survey — verdict">

**What it does.** A **timed** sweep of a whole space. Start it, walk the room
normally, and get a single verdict at the end — no needle-watching.

**What you see.** A countdown and progress bar while it runs, then a verdict card:

- **`CLEAN`** — nothing crossed the noise floor
- **`TRACE`** — brief or faint hits; worth a slower second pass
- **`ACTIVE READER`** — something was genuinely up and emitting

…with `MAX` / `AVG` field, contact count, and `FIELD %` — **how much of the survey
a carrier was actually up**, which is often the most telling number of the four.
Runs for 30 s, 60 s or 2 min, and logs the result automatically.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `OK` | Run the survey again |

<br clear="right">

### 🛰️ Watch Mode — *did one appear while I was away?*

<img src="images/screen_watch_hit.png" width="42%" align="right" alt="Watch Mode — reader present">

**What it does.** Stands guard **indefinitely**. Arm it, set the Flipper down,
walk away. Where Sweep is you hunting and Survey is a fixed-length test, Watch
just waits — for minutes or hours.

**What you see.** A large elapsed clock and `ALL CLEAR` while nothing is there.
The instant a reader appears the band inverts to **`READER PRESENT`**, the
**screen wakes**, and the alarm sounds. The band is steady rather than flashing —
a small marker pulses instead, so it reads as live without strobing at you. After it passes, the screen keeps the
evidence: `HITS` (how many separate contacts), `PEAK`, `LAST` (how long ago the
most recent one was) and `SEEN` (total time a carrier was actually up).

Watch **deliberately ignores stealth mode** — a dark, silent guard that never
tells you it saw something would be worse than useless.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `OK` | Re-arm — clears the clock and counters |

<br clear="right">

### 📖 Logbook — *what did I find, and when?*

Findings are saved **twice, from one action**, so they're readable on the device
*and* already a spreadsheet — no export step to remember:

<table>
<tr><th><code>logbook.txt</code> — grouped, for the on-device viewer</th><th><code>logbook.csv</code> — one flat row per entry</th></tr>
<tr><td>

```
2026-07-18 14:35:11
  SURVEY 60s ACTIVE max74…
2026-07-18 14:32:07
  READER POLLING 204ms…
```

</td><td>

```
timestamp,type,detail
2026-07-18 14:35:11,SURVEY,60s ACTIVE …
2026-07-18 14:32:07,READER,POLLING 204ms …
```

</td></tr>
</table>

Entries are tagged `SWEEP`, `READER`, `SURVEY` or `WATCH` and stamped from the
Flipper's clock. Both files live in `apps_data/specter/` on the SD card. Nothing
ever leaves the device. Clear them from **Settings → Clear logbook** (confirmed
first — it's the one irreversible thing the app can do).

---

## ⚙️ The supporting bits

### 🎯 Auto-calibration

Press **LEFT** on the Sweep screen and Specter listens to the **ambient noise
floor for 3 seconds**, then sets the detection threshold just above whatever it
measured — saved as your **Custom** sensitivity. Every room has a different RF
floor; this tunes to the one you're standing in rather than a number baked in at
build time. Stand somewhere quiet when you run it.

### 🕶️ Stealth mode

Keeps the **screen and LED dark** for the whole sweep, so the Flipper doesn't glow
while you're the one doing the looking. Sound and vibration keep working — the
point isn't to disable the feedback you're sweeping by. Exiting a stealth screen
re-lights the display, so `BACK` always lands you on a lit menu.

### 📏 Reading the meter

**Why a reader you're touching doesn't emit 100% of the time.** The detector
measures one physical thing: what fraction of the time a 13.56 MHz carrier is up.
But readers **poll** — a short burst, a sleep, another burst. A typical terminal
is only radiating **20–35% of the time**, so raw duty-cycle *saturates* around 30%
no matter how close you get.

Showing that raw number on the gauge made a perfect detection look like a third
of one. The meter is scaled against that real polling band instead:

| Raw carrier duty | Meter | Proximity |
|---|---|---|
| 3% (room noise) | 10% | `FAINT` |
| 12% | 40% | `NEAR` |
| 20% | 67% | `CLOSE` |
| 28% | 93% | `STRONG` |
| ≥30% *(resting on a reader)* | **100%** | `MAX` |

The **raw duty is never lost**: the noise floor, auto-calibration and the
Fingerprint screen's `DUTY` all still work in true duty-cycle, because those
describe the *signal*, not your distance from it. Want the literal number?
**Settings → Meter → Raw**.

### 💾 Everything persists

Sensitivity, survey length, sound, vibe, LED, stealth, logging and meter mode are
**saved to the SD card** the moment you change them. A sweep kit that forgets its
setup is worse than no persistence at all.

## 🧠 How it works

Every powered-on NFC reader continuously **pings the air with a 13.56 MHz carrier**, waiting for a card
to wake up. You can't see it, but the Flipper's NFC chip can: the **ST25R3916** has a hardware
**external-field detector** (the same circuit that lets the Flipper emulate a card and know when a reader
is talking to it). Specter parks the chip in detect-only mode and **samples that "field present?" bit
~500 times a second** — without ever switching on its own carrier.

That single bit, sampled fast enough, carries two independent signals:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["🔍 Hidden 13.56 MHz reader / skimmer<br/>(constantly polling its field)"] -- "RF carrier" --> A

    subgraph FLIP["Flipper Zero — Specter.fap"]
      A["ST25R3916 NFC chip<br/>external-field detector"] --> S["Sampler thread<br/>~500 samples/s"]
      S --> M["<b>How much?</b><br/>carrier duty-cycle<br/>peak · average · contacts"]
      S --> C["<b>What rhythm?</b><br/>burst / gap edge timing<br/>period · jitter"]
      M --> G["EMF gauge · waveform<br/>geiger clicks · LED · vibe"]
      M --> V["Survey verdict<br/>CLEAN / TRACE / ACTIVE"]
      C --> K["Emitter class<br/>CONTINUOUS / POLLING /<br/>INTERMITTENT + pulse train"]
      V --> L["📖 SD logbook"]
      K --> L
    end
```

**How much → strength.** Over a short window Specter measures *what fraction of the time* a carrier is
present and smooths it into the **FIELD %**. A reader sitting right on top of the Flipper pegs the meter;
a weaker or further one nudges it. That drives the needle, the proximity word and the click rate.

**What rhythm → identity.** Separately, every transition of that bit is timed. A reader that wakes for
20 ms every 200 ms produces a burst/gap pattern with almost no jitter, because its polling loop is
driven by a crystal-timed state machine. Hand movement and RF noise are not that steady. That
difference is what separates **POLLING** from **INTERMITTENT**.

### The decision layers are tested on a real computer

The places where Specter turns numbers into a *claim* — "this is a polling reader", "this room is
clean", "this is what the needle should read" — are pure C with no hardware dependencies, and they're
pinned down by host tests rather than discovered on the device:

```bash
make -C test     # 300 checks: classifier, verdict, meter scaling, presence
```

## 🚀 Install

No devboard, no firmware to flash — it's a single `.fap`.

**Option A — prebuilt `.fap` (easiest)**

1. Grab the right `.fap` from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/at0m-b0mb/Specter-FlipperZero/releases) page:

   | Your firmware | File |
   |---|---|
   | **Official / stock** | `specter.fap` |
   | **Unleashed, RogueMaster, Momentum** or anything newer | `specter-fw-dev.fap` |

   > If the Flipper says **`APP:87 < FW:88 — This app might not work`**, you have the
   > wrong one — take the other file. The app's API version is fixed when it's compiled,
   > so a single build can't satisfy both firmware lines. It usually still runs if you
   > press Continue, but the matching build won't ask.
2. Open **qFlipper**, drag the file onto `SD Card / apps / NFC /`.
3. On the Flipper: **Apps → NFC → Specter**.

**Option B — build it yourself with [`ufbt`](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt)**

```bash
# one-time
python3 -m pip install --upgrade ufbt

# from the repo root, with your Flipper plugged in over USB:
ufbt            # build specter.fap into ./dist
ufbt launch     # build, upload to the Flipper and open it
make -C test    # run the host tests for the pure logic
```

The `.fap` lands in `dist/specter.fap`; `ufbt launch` copies it to `apps/NFC/` and starts it for you.

## 🎮 Using it

**A sweep, end to end:**

1. Launch **Specter**. On the **Sweep** screen, press **LEFT** and hold still for 3 seconds to
   calibrate to the room's noise floor.
2. Hold the Flipper flat and move it **slowly** across the thing you're checking — a card terminal, a
   door reader, the underside of an ATM lip, a parcel, a desk.
   - **Quiet / flat waveform** → no active reader in range.
   - **Needle climbing, clicks speeding up** → you're approaching an emitter. Keep going toward the peak.
   - **`● ACTIVE READER` + alarm border** → an active reader is right here.
3. Found something? Back out and open **Fingerprint**. Hold the Flipper still against it and let the
   cadence settle — a few seconds is usually enough. Press **OK** to save the finding.
4. Clearing a whole room instead? Open **Site Survey**, walk the space until the bar fills, and read
   the verdict.
5. Leaving the area? Drop the Flipper in **Watch Mode** and it'll stand guard, waking and sounding off
   if a reader turns up while you're gone.
6. Check **Logbook** for everything you've saved, timestamped — or pull `logbook.csv` off the card
   into a spreadsheet.

> 💡 Sweep a known-good reader first (your own phone doing NFC, or a contactless terminal you trust) to
> see what a strong, legitimate field looks like on the meter — and what its fingerprint reads as. Then
> go hunting.

### Controls

| Screen | Key | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Sweep** | `OK` | Reset peak / contacts |
| | `hold OK` | Log the current reading |
| | `LEFT` | Calibrate the noise floor (3 s) |
| **Fingerprint** | `OK` | Save the finding to the logbook |
| | `hold OK` | Restart the measurement |
| **Site Survey** | `OK` | Run the survey again |
| **Watch Mode** | `OK` | Re-arm (clear count and clock) |
| *anywhere* | `BACK` | Up a level |

## 🔬 Honest limitations

- **13.56 MHz (HF) only.** Specter senses the **NFC band** — the one used by contactless payment skimmers,
  most modern access readers, transit and hotel readers. It **cannot** see **125 kHz (LF)** readers
  (older HID Prox / EM4100 door panels); the Flipper's LF path has no equivalent field-detect bit.
- **It senses a reader's *carrier*, not what it reads.** Specter tells you *an active reader is here,
  roughly how close, and what rhythm it polls on* — it does not decode, identify, or capture anything
  the reader does.
- **Strength is relative, not calibrated.** `FIELD %` and the proximity words are a comparative "warmer /
  colder" guide for sweeping, not a measured distance in cm. It's a *scaled* reading of carrier
  duty-cycle against a typical polling band (see [Reading the meter](#-reading-the-meter--fixed-in-23));
  a reader that polls unusually sparsely will read lower at the same distance, and one in continuous-wave
  mode will peg from further away.
- **The meter tops out.** `MAX` means the carrier is up as much as this reader ever keeps it up — past
  that point, closing in genuinely cannot produce a bigger number. Use the `PK` peak-hold to compare
  positions instead.
- **Cadence resolves to ~2 ms.** That's the sampling period. Timings anywhere near it are shown with a
  **`~`** and the confidence is discounted accordingly — Specter would rather flag its own resolution
  floor than quote a precise-looking number it can't stand behind.
- **`CLEAN` means clean at the sensitivity you chose.** A dormant skimmer that only wakes on a real tap,
  or one that's shielded, stays invisible at *any* threshold. Absence of a reading isn't a guarantee of
  absence.
- **One radio at a time.** Specter takes over the NFC chip while sweeping, so close any other NFC app first
  (it'll say *NFC unavailable* if something else holds the radio).

## ⚖️ Legal & ethical

Specter is a **defensive, listen-only** tool — it **never transmits**, never powers a field, never touches
the reader. Use it to sweep **your own** POS area, door, desk or belongings, or hardware you're **explicitly
authorised** to assess. You are responsible for how you use it. Know your local laws.
