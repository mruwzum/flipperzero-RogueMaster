# MTools for Flipper Zero

MTools is a Flipper Zero NFC application for checking magic tags, changing UIDs, and opening the compatible-card URL with NDEF emulation. The build uses the Flipper SDK through `ufbt`.

The app uses Flipper Zero's built-in NFC hardware and needs no expansion module.

## Publishing to the Flipper Apps Catalog

The `screenshots/` directory contains unedited qFlipper screenshots for the Catalog.

To submit version 1.0 or a later version, update `fap_version` in `application.fam`,
add a matching `vmajor.minor:` section to `CHANGELOG.md`, and push a commit whose
subject is exactly `release: major.minor` to `main`. The release workflow builds
with the release SDK, validates the Catalog bundle, and opens a PR from the
MTools Tec Catalog fork. Other commits do not publish. The repository must have
the `FLIPPER_CATALOG_TOKEN` Actions secret with access to the Catalog fork.

## Adding a tool

1. Put its state machine and NFC orchestration in `features/<tool>.c/.h`. Keep drawing in `ui/<tool>_ui.c/.h`.
2. Add its scene route in `mtools_app.c` and its source files in `application.fam`.
3. Use `nfc/card_info.h` for scanner protocol classification and `nfc/card_reader.h` for scanner start and scanner/poller stop. Send a custom event to the view dispatcher for scene transitions; a probe that needs the active poller may run in its ready callback.
4. Put reusable card commands in `nfc/`. Keep generation-specific command sequences in `magic_detector.c` or `magic_writer.c`, rather than in UI code.
5. If a detection cannot be proven without changing a card, return an unconfirmed result. Writes must verify the result by reading back from the card.

Run `ufbt` to build. With a connected Flipper, run `ufbt launch FLIP_PORT=<serial-port>` to install and start the FAP.

GDM/USCUID UID writes first try the card's GDM or Gen1a magic wakeup. If both
are disabled, the writer tries the card's `0x80` Crypto1 magic authentication
with the default zero key, temporarily enables its configured wakeup, and then
writes the UID. It builds the public block 0 and the hidden block needed for a
seven-byte UID, switches the personalization byte only after the UID blocks are
ready, and restores the original wakeup setting. Each block and the final UID
are verified. A failed write after the temporary configuration is enabled may
leave `7A FF` enabled so the card can be recovered through its magic wakeup.
