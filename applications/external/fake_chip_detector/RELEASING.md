# Releasing

Six places end up holding a copy of this app, and the only thing that keeps them honest is
that they all point at **the same commit**. This is the order that gets them there.

- the GitHub release, with one `.fap` per firmware
- the Apps Catalog manifest, which pins a `commit_sha`
- `xMasterX/all-the-plugins`, which carries the source
- `Next-Flip/Momentum-Apps`, which carries the source as a subtree
- `djsime1/awesome-flipperzero`, which only carries a link

v0.7.0 got this slightly wrong: it was tagged at `927f7c4`, then five PRs landed — including the
clang-format sweep — and the catalog was submitted at `f7df74a`. Nothing broke, because none of
the five changed behaviour, but the binaries people downloaded were not built from the code the
catalog builds. Cut the tag last and the question does not arise.

v0.8.0 got it wrong the same way and then fixed it, which is the more useful half of the story.
The tag was cut at `9848135`; validating the catalog manifest then turned up backticks in the
changelog, and the fix landed as `8a8aade`. The first instinct was to explain the mismatch in the
release notes. **Move the tag instead** — it takes a minute and leaves nothing to explain:

```bash
git tag -f v0.8.0 <new commit> && git push -f origin v0.8.0
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v0.8.0
```

`release.yml` uploads with `--clobber`, so the rebuilt assets replace the old ones in place and
the download URLs do not change. Then delete whatever apology the notes had picked up.

## 1. Before the tag

```bash
python tools/gen_supported_chips.py --check     # CI runs this too
ufbt format                                     # in fake_chip_detector/, if anything changed
```

Bump `fap_version` in `fake_chip_detector/application.fam` — **the catalog rejects a
resubmission that reuses a version**, and a review comment on the open catalog PR means a new
version, not an amended commit. Add the matching entry to `fake_chip_detector/docs/changelog.md`,
which is what the catalog renders — **with no backticks in it**. The changelog goes through the
same markdown checker as the description (`Markdown element 'Backtick' is not allowed`), which
0.7 happened to satisfy by accident and 0.8 did not. Bold instead. Nothing catches this until
`tools/bundle.py` runs, which is after the tag is cut unless you check first. The pack copies carry it as `CHANGELOG.md` in the app
directory instead — that is what `all-the-plugins`' PR template asks for — so copy it across
under that name when you re-copy the app in step 3.

Merge all of that to `master` through a PR, as usual. Everything below starts from a `master`
that is finished.

## 2. Create the release — with no files attached

```bash
gh release create v0.8.0 --prerelease --title "v0.8.0" --notes-file notes.md
```

**Do not pass any `.fap` files here.** The `release: published` event starts
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the three firmwares and uploads them with
`--clobber`. Attaching files by hand at the same time races that upload; the workflow wins
sometimes and you get a file built from who-knows-what the rest of the time. Let the workflow be
the only thing that writes assets.

Watch it, and check all three arrived:

```bash
gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow=release.yml -L1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
gh release view v0.8.0 --json assets --jq '[.assets[].name]'
```

The workflow builds against each firmware's **current** `release` SDK, so the API version on
the assets moves whenever that SDK does. Within one major that is a non-event — the loader
compares the major and nothing else (see BACKLOG.md) — and a firmware bump on its own is not a
reason to re-cut binaries. What is worth checking when the SDK major has moved, or when a
release adds code, is that the app imports nothing the older firmware lacks:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-readelf -sW dist/fake_chip_detector.fap | awk '$7=="UND" && $8!=""{print $8}' | sort -u
```

against `targets/f7/api_symbols.csv` from the oldest firmware you mean to support.

If a firmware's SDK is broken that day the other two still upload (`fail-fast: false`). Say so
in the release notes rather than pretending three builds exist. To retry one later:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v0.8.0
```

## 3. Update the four downstream places

All four point at the release commit — `git rev-parse v0.8.0`.

| Where | What to change |
|---|---|
| [flipper-application-catalog](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipper-application-catalog) | `applications/GPIO/fake_chip_detector/manifest.yml`: new `commit_sha` |
| [all-the-plugins](https://github.com/xMasterX/all-the-plugins) | re-copy the app into `non_catalog_apps/fake_chip_detector/`; base the branch on **`dev`**, not `main` |
| [Momentum-Apps](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Apps) | re-copy into `fake_chip_detector/`; `.gitsubtree` stays as it is; base on **`dev`** |
| [awesome-flipperzero](https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero) | its one line carries the chip count, so in practice every release that adds a chip touches it |

**The pack copies are not byte-identical to this repository, and a plain re-copy silently
reverts the differences.** After copying, re-apply both:

- `docs/changelog.md` goes in as `CHANGELOG.md` in the app directory (all-the-plugins asks for it
  there; Momentum carries it for consistency).
- In `LIVE_TESTS.md`, the two `../test_plugin_template` links become
  `https://github.com/hleserg/flipper-fake-chip-detector/tree/master/test_plugin_template`, and
  the second one reads "in the upstream repository" rather than "in the repository root".
- **`README.md` in both packs is a different document from this repository's
  `fake_chip_detector/README.md`.** The one here is a stub pointing one directory up, which is
  useless in a pack; the packs carry a standalone description instead, and it holds the chip
  count, the identified-by-ID count and the live-test count. Exclude it from the copy and edit
  the counts in place. A plain re-copy replaces it with the stub and no build fails.

The copy itself, both packs (Momentum also keeps `.gitsubtree`):

```bash
rsync -a --delete --exclude dist --exclude docs --exclude .clang-format --exclude .vscode \
      --exclude screenshots --exclude CHANGELOG.md --exclude LICENSE --exclude README.md \
      --exclude .gitsubtree fake_chip_detector/ <pack>/fake_chip_detector/
```

`.vscode/` and `screenshots/` are in this repository and in neither pack. `--delete` does not
touch anything named in an `--exclude`, which is what keeps `LICENSE` and `.gitsubtree` alive.

```bash
grep -rn '](\.\./' non_catalog_apps/fake_chip_detector/    # must print nothing
```

Two more traps that have already cost a round trip each:

- **Base branch.** Both packs develop on `dev` and `gh pr create` will happily open the PR
  against `main` instead, which produces an eleven-thousand-file diff that no maintainer will
  read. Check `changedFiles` after opening it; `gh pr edit <n> --base dev` fixes it in place.
- **The ReadMe index.** `all-the-plugins` keeps a curated table at `ReadMe.md`; the merged
  app-addition PRs add a row to it in the block for the app's category. The catalog cell stays
  `![None Badge]` until the app is actually live on lab.flipper.net.

Validate the catalog manifest before pushing, from a checkout of the catalog repo — **twice**,
because the second form is the one CI runs:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
PATH=<dir holding ufbt>:$PATH .venv/bin/python tools/bundle.py --nolint \
    applications/GPIO/fake_chip_detector/manifest.yml bundle.zip
PATH=<dir holding ufbt>:$PATH .venv/bin/python tools/bundle.py \
    applications/GPIO/fake_chip_detector/manifest.yml bundle.zip
```

The requirements are under `tools/`, not at the root, and `bundle.py` shells out to `ufbt` by
name — without it on `PATH` the failure is `FileNotFoundError: 'ufbt'` several screens into a
traceback.

## 4. Screenshots and description, if they changed

- Screenshots for the catalog must be **512x256 or 1024x512** — the 128x64 screen at exactly 4x
  or 8x. A native capture is rejected outright.
- `fake_chip_detector/docs/catalog_description.md` may use H1-H2, bold, italic, lists and links
  and nothing else. A table or a single backtick is a hard error, not a silent drop. This is why
  the description is its own file and not the README.

## 5. Which builds have actually been run

The README says only the Unleashed build has been run on hardware. Before saying anything more
generous, run the thing: build, install, and walk scan → verdict → one live test on the firmware
in question. Compiling against three SDKs is not three firmwares having run it.
