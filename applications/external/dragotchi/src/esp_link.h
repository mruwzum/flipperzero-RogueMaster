 * firmware, which emits lines of the form:
 *     DRAGO wifi=<count> rssi=<-dbm>
 * on the UART at ESP_LINK_BAUD. Receive-only from the Flipper's side.
 *
 * Returns true and fills the outputs when a valid report is received within
 * ESP_PROBE_MS; false when the board is absent or silent (game falls back to
 * pure sub-GHz hunting). Safe to call when no board is attached. */
