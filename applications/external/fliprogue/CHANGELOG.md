# Changelog

v1.2.2:
- Fixed dropping worn cursed Charms bypassing their removal restriction. Decurse still unlocks them; unworn cursed Charms may still be dropped.
- Added regression tests for Charm removal, item dropping, and the v1.2.1 stairs/chest interaction priority through the real button handler.

v1.2.1:
- Fixed OK interaction priority so stairs, shrines, and other current-tile actions win over adjacent chests.

v1.2:
- Reduced saved-floor and pathfinding RAM pressure for more stable device runs.
- Fixed coarse saved exploration revealing extra remembered wall tiles.
- Tuned low-HP LED feedback to stay red instead of leaking the previous green state.

v1.1:
- Added dungeon decorators, hazards, flooded rooms, deep water, ice, fire fields, grates, shrines, chests, mimics, and lurkers.
- Added persistent high scores and sound settings on SD.
- Reworked UI modules, tile sprites, item interactions, class perks, and documentation for the first public catalog-ready release.
- Improved teleport, blink, eel, charm, LED feedback, and trap behavior.
