# Changelog

## 2.16

- Documentation only: replaced the SVG screen mockups with real device
  screenshots, refreshed the README (screen set now shows Overview and Export,
  tidier Roadmap and project layout, no stale version labels), and removed the
  unused app-catalog scaffolding (catalog/ and screenshots/). No app changes
  since 2.15.

## 2.15

- Main menu simplified: the standalone "Punch" entry was removed (Work mode
  already handles clock in/out), and "Overview" now sits right under "Work
  mode". New order: Work mode, Overview, Badges, History, Export, Settings,
  About.
- Dead code removed with it: the unused MenuIndexPunch entry and its handler,
  and the now-unused "Punch" menu string in all five languages.

## 2.14

- Overview page now shows only the collaborator name in bold; the stat lines
  below (today/week/month/break) are drawn in regular weight. The font was
  never switched back after the bold name, so every line rendered bold.
- Docs screenshots rebuilt at the real 128x64 screen resolution to match the
  app faithfully: the actual submenu look (header, inverted selection bar,
  scrollbar, no divider line), the Work/Scan chevrons and technology footer,
  the single-line greeting, and the Today text box with date-prefixed punches.

## 2.13

- Work mode cooldown lowered from 60s to 2s: the 60s debounce was a leftover
  from before the reader-level flood fix (2.12) and made a real OUT punch a
  few seconds after IN not register at all. The reader itself now guards
  against a lingering badge re-triggering, so the cooldown only needs to
  swallow one physical tap's duplicate.
- Work mode clock/greeting text was drawn off-center (x=70) while the date
  and technology label used x=64; all three now share x=64 so nothing looks
  misaligned.
- Overview page's Left/Right hint arrows now use the same minimal chevron
  shape and size as Work mode and Scan, instead of plain "<"/">" text.

## 2.12

- Fixed another Work mode freeze, right after the first IN: the NFC poller
  in continuous mode never stopped itself on a read, so a badge still in
  the field kept re-triggering it as fast as the radio could re-detect it,
  flooding the event queue faster than the GUI thread could drain it. The
  poller now always stops itself on a read; continuous mode re-arms it
  explicitly afterward, paced by actual reads instead of the radio's raw
  poll rate. LF RFID and iButton are unaffected (no per-read stop signal
  to begin with).
- Left/Right chevrons moved from screen-center height to the same row as
  the NFC/RFID/iBTN label at the bottom, on both the Scan and Work mode
  screens.

## 2.11

- Fixed a device freeze on tap: the NFC poller was never told its own
  worker thread should stop on a read (a regression from the reader
  rewrite in 2.9/2.10), so the GUI thread's teardown raced an actively
  running poller thread. NFC taps in Scan and Work mode both froze the
  device solid. RFID and iButton were unaffected. Restored the exact
  v1.3.0 shutdown signaling.
- Replaced the on-screen "<"/">" button labels and "< NFC >" bracket
  text with a minimal V-shaped chevron drawn at each screen edge, and
  moved the active technology name to the same spot (bottom center) on
  both the Scan and Work mode screens.

## 2.10

- Manual technology selection extended to Punch, register and replace-chip:
  the round-robin rotation is now gone from the app entirely (not just
  Work mode), and the "waiting for a tap" screen shows the active
  technology with Left/Right to change it, same as Work mode. The choice
  is shared between both screens and remembered across restarts.

## 2.9

- Work mode freeze fixed for real: every attempt at automatically rotating
  NFC/RFID/iButton in Work mode (fast, slow, with a pause after each read)
  eventually froze the device. Checked the pre-rotation v1.3.0 reader,
  which never used a timer and was never reported unstable - Work mode now
  works the same way: it locks onto one technology at a time, switched with
  Left/Right (shown as "< NFC >" etc. in the footer instead of the exit
  hint), and remembers your last choice across sessions and restarts.
- License section in all five READMEs restyled: a short "what this means in
  practice" bullet list instead of a plain paragraph.

## 2.8

- Reverted 2.7's fix: stopping and restarting the reader after every read in
  Work mode froze the device solid (no input worked at all, needed a hard
  reset) instead of fixing the IN/OUT loop - the extra alloc/free cycle on
  top of the already-delicate radio rotation is the more likely trigger for
  that class of hang. Work mode no longer touches the reader after a read;
  the 60s same-badge cooldown (2.6) already blocks a repeat punch on its
  own, without needing to stop anything.
- App icon redrawn again: the hands no longer touch the outer ring, and the
  two hands are now clearly different lengths (short hour, long minute).
- Registering a new chip now plays a sound/vibro/LED cue (honoring the
  Settings toggles) the moment it's read, instead of staying silent until
  the chip is saved with a name.

## 2.7

- The 2.6 debounce fix was not enough: Work mode could still loop IN/OUT
  after a punch even with the badge already pulled away, which meant
  something besides a lingering badge was re-triggering reads. Work mode now
  fully stops the reader (no radio allocated, no poller running) for 5s
  after every read, punch or unknown badge alike, instead of only debouncing
  by time; the scene resumes scanning once the pause elapses. Nothing can
  produce a read event while the reader is stopped, regardless of cause.

## 2.6

- Fixed a runaway IN/OUT loop in Work mode: the same-badge debounce was only
  3.5s, and the reader keeps re-reporting a badge for as long as it sits in
  the field, so a badge left near the Flipper too long kept re-triggering
  punches every 3.5s, alternating IN/OUT indefinitely until pulled away.
  Raised to 60s.
- About screen no longer shows the "GPL-3.0-or-later" line under the
  copyright notice.
- App icon redrawn again with bolder, wider hands so the 10:10 shape reads
  clearly instead of blending into the rim.

## 2.5

- Fixed a hang: Work mode's continuous badge scan rotated NFC/RFID/iButton
  every 500ms forever, tearing down and recreating each radio (including a
  dedicated worker thread for LF RFID and iButton) every time. Left running
  for a while, that churn could wedge the device and force a hard reset. The
  continuous slice is now 4s instead of 500ms; single-shot scans are
  unaffected.
- PIN is now fully optional everywhere: Work mode no longer requires one to
  be set, only at least one registered collaborator. Leaving Work mode or
  the app from the main menu asks for the PIN if one is set, and exits
  immediately if not.
- Settings: the button shown when no PIN is set is now "Enable PIN" instead
  of "Set PIN", to read as the counterpart to "Disable PIN".
- Main menu reordered: Work mode, Badges, Punch, then Overview, History,
  Export, Settings, About.
- App icon redrawn again: the clock hands read closer to 11:05 than 10:10;
  they now spread out more horizontally toward the 10 and 2 positions.

## 2.4

- Fixed a crash: the round-robin badge reader now switches radios on the GUI
  thread instead of the timer service thread, which could hard-fault the
  device on almost any scan or punch.
- Today / This week / This month moved under History, so the main menu has
  fewer buttons.
- New Overview screen: a per-collaborator dashboard (today / week / month
  worked time and today's break); Left/Right switches between people.
- About screen shortened to a quick description, the repo link and the
  copyright notice.
- Settings: disabling the PIN now shows a clear confirmation instead of
  returning silently; "Exit app" renamed to "Exit".
- Onboarding PIN screen text shortened so it always fits on screen.
- Startup warning if the Flipper's clock looks wrong (older than this
  release), so punches are never silently misdated.
- App icon redrawn with the clock hands at 10:10.

## 2.3

- Correct worked-time totals for shifts that cross midnight (an OUT on the next
  day now closes the IN from the evening before, counted on the shift's start
  day).
- Manual correction: add a missing IN or OUT at the current time from
  Badges -> (person) -> Add IN / Add OUT (fixes a forgotten tap).
- Export the current month to its own CSV (Export -> Export month).
- Optional daily target hours (Settings -> Target); Today shows the target and
  the overtime (or shortfall).
- Reader reworked to scan NFC, RFID and iButton in rotation (one radio at a
  time) instead of all at once - lighter on memory, still no manual selection.

## 2.2

- iButton (1-Wire Dallas keys) supported as a third badge technology.
- Reader auto-detects NFC, RFID and iButton with no manual selection.
- Any existing card works (even one issued by another company): only the UID is
  read, never written.

## 2.1

- This month summary (worked time per collaborator).
- Undo last punch per collaborator.
- Warning when the Flipper clock is not set.

## 2.0

- Backup and restore of badges and punch history.

## 1.0

- Register collaborators, automatic IN/OUT punching, Work mode kiosk, history,
  daily and weekly summaries, CSV/JSON export, PIN-protected exit, five UI
  languages.
