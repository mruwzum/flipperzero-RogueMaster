# Contributing to Staff Time Clock

Thanks for your interest in improving Staff Time Clock! This document explains how to
build the app, the conventions we follow, and how to propose changes.

## Ground rules

- **Be respectful.** All participation is covered by our
  [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **English only.** All code, comments, identifiers, UI strings, file names and
  documentation are written in English.
- **Stay in scope.** This app performs **badge identification only** (reading a
  UID). Pull requests that add badge **emulation**, cloning, or anything meant to
  **bypass access-control/authentication** will not be accepted. See
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Getting set up

This is a Flipper Zero external app (FAP) for the **official firmware**, built
with [`ufbt`](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade ufbt
```

From the project root (the folder with `application.fam`):

```bash
ufbt            # build the .fap (output in dist/)
ufbt launch     # build, upload to a connected Flipper, and run it
ufbt cli        # open the Flipper CLI for logs while testing
```

## Code style

- Follow the existing style: 4-space indentation, braces on the same line,
  Flipper naming (`snake_case` functions, `PascalCase` types).
- Prefixes: `tc_*` for storage/PIN helpers, `timeclock_*` for app/scene
  functions, `TimeClock*` / `Tc*` for types and enums.
- Keep the radio-specific code isolated in `scenes/timeclock_scene_scan.c`.
- If your toolchain provides it, format C sources with `ufbt format` (clang-format)
  before committing.

## Adding a screen (scene)

1. Add an entry to `scenes/timeclock_scene_config.h`
   (`ADD_SCENE(timeclock, my_scene, MyScene)`).
2. Create `scenes/timeclock_scene_my_scene.c` implementing
   `timeclock_scene_my_scene_on_enter/on_event/on_exit`.
3. The X-macro tables in `timeclock_scene.c` and the `TimeClockScene` enum update
   automatically.

## Commit messages

- Use clear, imperative subject lines: `Add weekly summary to Today screen`.
- Reference issues where relevant: `Fix #12: ...`.
- Keep unrelated changes in separate commits/PRs.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make sure the app **builds** (`ufbt`) and, ideally, runs on a device or in the
   emulator.
3. Update `README.md` / docs if behavior changes.
4. Open a PR and fill in the template. Describe what you changed, how you tested
   it, and on which firmware/version.

## Reporting bugs & requesting features

Open a GitHub issue with:

- what you expected vs. what happened,
- your Flipper firmware name and version,
- badge technology involved (NFC / LF RFID) if relevant,
- steps to reproduce.

For **security** issues, do **not** open a public issue - follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
